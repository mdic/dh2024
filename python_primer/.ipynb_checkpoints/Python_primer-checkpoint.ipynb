    "# Cooking with Python: a culinary analogy\n",
    "Let's pretend you have just bought a new apartment in Italy, and that it comes pre-furnished. In it you have a kitchen, a basic one; let's pretend it's a *basic Italian kitchen*. A kitchen where you will find all the tools and ingredients that are needed to prepare the basic Italian dishes: an oven, a stove, some pans, some cutlery; pasta, salt, pepper, olive oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic.  \n",
    "You won't find Garam Masala in it, nor sushi rice, nor a wok. Just a basic Italian kitchen to get you started with Italian dishes.  \n",
    "The default Python installation is just like this kitchen: it has the basic tools and ingredients (called **modules** or **libraries**) and nothing more.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now, you have invited some friends over for an Indian dinner, and you are going to prepare a Tikka Masala curry. Your basic kitchen doesn't have a lot of the things needed - some of which are commonly available from any store in Italy, some others that can only be found in specialised stores. Chicken and yoghurt can easily be found in any supermarket; curry spices and coconut milk can be bought in Asian markets. \n",
    "Similarly in Python you may need to get some **modules from outside as they are not available in the basic installation**; this is commonly done through a module manager called [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if one of your guests is coeliac? Well, you'd have to get some special ingredients, as well as using tools that must not come in contact with @@@. You would have to keep these ingredients and tools separate from the other ones, since mixing them may cause serious consequences: the former are conflicting with the latter.  \n",
    "The same may happen with Python modules: you may be using a module that requires specific versions of other modules, which in turn may be incompatible with an additional module. Luckily with Python you can create a **virtual environment** (often called `venv`), a self-contained and isolated \"box\" into which you can install modules and keep them separated from modules installed inside of a second virtual environment."
