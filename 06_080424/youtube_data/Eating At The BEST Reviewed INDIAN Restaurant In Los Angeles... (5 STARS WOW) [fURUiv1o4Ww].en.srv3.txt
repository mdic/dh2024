reviews
wow exactly so welcome back to a brand
new episode of
my fortunate life choices
starring yours julie brennan taylor this

felt like you know i want to give some
love back to the indian people
they're constantly bumping my music out
there so i got to show some love back
and they're in a huge you know crisis
right now because of kovitz so our
thoughts and prayers are with them but
let's jump into these reviews and let's
see what the people
are thinking about this place cool my
go-to indian food around here i will
swim in that fish coconut curry
it is that good even my friends who
don't normally eat indian food will eat
from there
the food is fresh rich and flavorful do
not miss out if you are in the mood for
some
bomb ass curry get a side of garlic naan
to wrap up all that leftover curry sauce
they always have the best service and
are accurate with their pick up times
when that call to order in
even her friends that don't like indian
food still like this place
that's saying something because you know
indian food is very it's very niche
you know i mean you either really like
that type of food or you don't at all i
haven't really eaten it that much just
that one time in london
and then that one star that we went and
then that other time at that bomb by
frankie yeah so it could be like a
couple of times and here's a couple
pictures of the inside
it looks like fine dining it looks like
fine dining indian
like suit and tie my family and i
discovered this hidden gem
actually not hidden as it has been voted
as la's best indian food
wow that's good to know that's even
information to me yeah
and we loved every single morsel of food
that we ordered
i love indian food but anabarg which is
the name of the place indian food is the
best one by far we will definitely come
back
and bring more family members with us

they drove that and it says that they
checked in so they legit
went there and they're saying it's the
best in l.a yeah and like
you know they're from beverly hills they
got money so they should try all the
indian spots
it seems like they have yeah came here
yesterday for valentine's day with my
husband and son
amazing service clean food is delicious
always 10 out of 10. this is our
favorite indian food cuisine in the
valley and let's check out this picture
they uploaded
oh chicken tikka masala
right there this looks good this looks
like a lot of food what is that
i don't know but we're gonna find out so
no more wasting any time
let's head on over there and let's get
some indian food let's go to me i ain't
happy in the house
so we just got in here it's super
peaceful very
zen i almost feel like i can meditate in
here i don't know if this is exactly how
like india
decorates inside but it definitely makes
you feel very at peace very relaxed
we just got the menu so uh let's check
them out
[Music]
we'll get the mango lassi and then can
we get the masala tea with milk
okay and then just two waters thank you
so they gave us these salsas right here
i'm gonna call them salsas i don't know
if that's what you call them in
uh and indian food are they salsas
sauces sauces i don't know let's try
them they give us these like cracker
type
things that are like i wanted to say
none but they're like
chips don't really have a smell nothing
that i can really smell
put a little bit of this green one on
there this is the mint one
wow it's like a paper thin yeah it's
kind of good though i like that
this red one's like very like sweet
sweet kind of like delicious like you
can drink it
the red ones reminds me most of the
salsa and what are we going to order
that's the real question
i mean the prices are pretty good like
look you can get a whole like
for one a lunch chicken or a lunch lamb
for 13 bucks
they have a big menu a huge menu with so
many items it's almost a little bit like
scary to look at like i'm like what do i
want we want to get this
um the assorted appetizer for two okay
all right here's the drink all right so
this is the mango lassi we tried this
i remember at the one star yeah that's
the only time i've ever tried this
before
because billy really wanted it yeah we
tried it actually while eating at the
gas station one too
but it was a lot different than this it
was like that was more like a smoothie
oh it was a smoothie this one's more
like not a drink drink it drink it drink
it
it tastes like a dan a damn animal
it tastes like an animal but like you
know how those things are so small you
just like pound them down yeah you got a
full drink
so is lassie like a yogurt is that what
that is i'm trying to understand yeah
it's like a yogurt drink
oh it's very thick it definitely has
that texture
it's a yogurt and mango shake
that's good stuff right there yeah for
the whole beverage before your meal i
feel like you'll get you'll get fully
saying we should just taste it yeah i
could imagine being in india walking
down the street and they just have big
gallons
with a big spoon and they're just like
we got to go to india yeah look
speaking of india i know that they're
having some major crisis out there right
now so
we're definitely going to be donating i
highly recommend you guys donate to i'll
put a link down below if you can
or even just send some positive thoughts
and vibrations out to them they're
really struggling
and uh giving them our love and
appreciation
we're trying to appreciate them by
eating some good indian food today
look at this so this is the front of
their menu it's pretty pretty decently
sized with a bunch of different items
just when you think you've seen it all
you turn this thing over
and oh my god they've got more so let's
definitely get the chicken tikka masala
definitely need to try that and then
we're going to get the lamb rogan josh
and we definitely want some
garlic done
oh let's get what this is a big decision
one two ten foods pretty spicy i say we
go a solid like
seven i say i was gonna say six and a
half six and a half seven
okay i can't risk it two of that too
much guys hand down for a little bit hot
all right let's go seven
okay so yeah like hot i'm not high like
seven
oh what's that
wow we should try it can we drink it
how old do you i'm 26. i'm 28.
yeah okay one like
okay thank you yeah it's the best beer
in india
so they just gave us a bottle of this
taj mahal it's a premium lager beer
and they said this is the best in india
wow so i mean i'm excited to try that
because
it's not every day that you're drinking
indian beer yeah thank you very much
i like the glass even the glass look at
that even the glasses say taj mahal you
turn them around
and there's the taj mahal we love that
oh they gave you a regular glass
i'm never special
what is a taylor bro review without a
beer so
it's very crisp it's very light it is
light it's
it's comparable to like a beer that i
would normally
drink like a corona if i was drinking a
mexican beer or like pacifico or even a
stella it's a light blonde
in india it's hot out there from what
i've seen online it's hot out there
imagine just walking up into your
favorite pub grabbing a beer like this
and just taking the load off you know
yeah what should we start with
all right one of these okay so we're
gonna we're gonna start with the lamb
tikka first
wow yeah that i think that's the first
time i've ever had
full lamb i'm gonna go to other like
mediterranean places and like
it's usually on a bone right no no it's
usually like a like
when it's on a kebab it's like ground
meat so it's like a lot softer this one
when it has like that
it was very like a thick piece it's a
dense piece of meat like when i bit into
this thing i said oh my gosh
yeah i tried to bite it in half and i
couldn't yeah you can hear it ripped
sauce that they make they probably make
it homemade here it's just a flavor
booster it's a flavor enhancer
it makes every flavor a little bit
better let's try this the zika bob first
oh my god what i noticed about indian
food is like flavors and their smells
are so strong
they have layers of flavor maybe your
initial your medium and then your end
note
when you're just like you still taste a
different seasoning you know
so when i went to school i took like a
class about
like where where humans come from and
stuff right
they were saying in the early early ages
that
when everyone was coming to like the
world you know traveling the indian
indian people and latin people would end
up
getting together and marrying because
in the latin culture we have tortillas
in
india we have nan and then all our they
have uh
we have beans they have like lentils so
it's like a similar thing they make
little uh
so it makes sense why some of the the
food is kind of similar in a way and
you guys say you never learn anything on
this channel look at us we're learning
now
oh and by the way have you guys seen the
brand new merch that i'm wearing it says
happy in the hills on the front and on
the back it says
i'm in a city full of angels i fell in
love with a devil and a halo so pick it
up it's got a cool design on the back so
you guys have to check it out on the
website because i can't get up
let's try this chicken tikka
oh wow that's just solid white meat
right there the crisp
on the edges from the grill is to die
for and now we're going to move on to
the fried onions over here
i ain't kissing anyone today are you
nope let's do it
what the oh wow on the inside
so it's like kind of like a hash brown
yeah it's like a it is like a hash brown
this is what it looks like it's
fresh grilled onions on the inside but
on the outside it's like a deep fried
batter type onion it's literally
hashbrowns but made with onions instead
of potatoes
surprisingly i don't hate it and every
time i order something i always say no
onions i mean no straight onions there's
no onion like flavor though with this
yeah it's like that's all gone if you
eat it with no sauce yeah it tastes like
a fried onion
i need a ring it does next thing is this
what did you say
it's like a potato filled something oh
okay so now we have the samosa
it looks like a giant yeah tostinos
pizza roll
let's open this up and let's see what's
on the inside
but let's try it
oh wow hot each thing in this appetizer
had totally different flavors too
totally different flavors but they're
all very distinctive and very much
wanting to be
known when we did have bombay frankies
right out of the gas station like
i noticed this too their flavors pop
that's the thing about it is like
they're
very much just i'm here let it be known
type
all right now we still got full dishes
to come but uh maybe you should go hit a
bathroom review oh
i gotta make some room so let's go
no luck and this is jake's bathroom
review all right here we are they got
these very
chic little red dividers they got a
urinal my favorite it's a two-person
restroom let's check this out hopefully
no one's in here okay because the lights
are off it'll be weird if someone was in
here
it's very clean it literally smells like
they just came in here and cleaned it
before i went in here everything looks
really good
i have no complaints about this at all
like this is a beautiful restaurant
i could live here all right back to the
food i was delivered over here
in masala tea not exactly sure what's
inside of this
not even sure what it's made out of but
i just know it's the masala tea with
milk
so yeah might be oh my god
smell that wow wow that's like this
feels like bed bath to beyond's most
famous candy yeah but it also kind of
reminds me of like the the mex the
the mexican hot chocolate background
yeah you know like just something that
you want to have during the holidays to
open you up
it definitely feels like it's for the
holidays it almost has like a cinnamon
in there like deep down in there that's
kind of like inviting or almost like a
gingerbread house of some sort i don't
know let me taste this it feels very hot
though there is no added sugar in there
so
interesting interesting oh here we come
the food
so the food just interrupted my masala
tea but look i am not even pissed about
it because this
looks incredible and jake was right
there is similarities to like
mexican food like this honestly reminds
me of like a fajita plate in a way like
there is a lot of similarities to the
latin culture
and maybe that's why i'm already
starting to love indian food but
it tastes so good so far here's how they
do the design do they add it like one by
one at the end
it's gotta be a sauce it's gotta be a
sauce oh maybe it is a sauce yeah
we thought it was yellow rice yeah
individually placing a design hey
so first things first let's look at the
lamb rogan josh i don't know why it's
called bam rogan josh maybe
seth rogen and josh richards are
together making a collaboration
i don't know looks really good the lamb
looks very tender it looks
soft it looks like i'm gonna bite into
it i'm gonna have some pull factor
jumping into the chicken tikka marsala
man i was a little worried that it was
gonna be exactly the same as what we got
but
i was wrong it is kind of like a curry
form and then jumping into our chicken
tikka plate
that's what this is right uh we didn't
order that he just gave us oh
i don't know i don't know what this is i
was wondering what this is he brought us
out like a like a fajita plate and it
looks
fantastic it looks spectacular and last
but not least our non in our rice
i'm super ecstatic we have a lot of
different things to try here so let's
just make our plates
and then we'll start trying
so the first thing let's try let's jump
into the typical
chicken tikka marsala all right here we
go
oh my god wow wow the last time i had
something like
where it was like indian food and i was
like wow this is pretty good was when i
had the trader joe's
heatable chicken tikka masala and that
like
did this know justice now that i've
actually had like the real thing from a
five-star spot like
i understand the hype that is delicious
yeah
and i'm pretty sure in the indian
culture they don't use silverware
they do right with the non and they make
little things like this
man the chicken is so tender and so
juicy
and like the masala all around man
this is to die for like make me a
burrito like chicken tikka is dipping
into my masala so i'm just going to eat
this one right here
a fajita plate but better like i feel
like they cook their chicken better than
they do at mexican restaurants when
you're having fajitas the next thing we
have on our place is the lamb
rogan josh jake says we eat it the same
exact way so
we eat everything with this do we that's
why he asked you on one or two just like
one more time yeah we need more
i'm gonna do it all with my hands just
grab it here we go
that one's spicier oh man maybe a seven
was good
i can feel the heat up on that chicken
wasn't spicy at all no maybe you only do
this with one of them i'm not a big
lamb guy i know you are so you can speak
more on this but that's like really nice
every time i've ever had plant before i
i wasn't a huge fan of it but now i like
it
it's definitely different than the
appetizer we have those are very chunks
this one's more like shredded out of
those two what do you prefer the lamb
you prefer the lamb yeah i really prefer
the chicken man i just feel like i wish
i didn't
waste so much of my life not trying
other foods because this is amazing
like i'm already kind of tapping out i'm
already tapping out i didn't i didn't
even get to the rice review you already
ate it i already ate the rice because
it's just like plain rice but when you
mix it in with the sauce
that's when it hits back to this real
quick i needed to do a masala tea review
i literally took a sip of the food came
so i'm trying
i will say it smells a lot better than
it tastes it tastes like
watered down milk if i had to choose
between this or like some like english
tea
you know english black tea with some
milk i would choose the english black
tea or that yeah that
that would definitely be better
incredible
delicious since being in here we have
been receiving like
constant service like they're asking
like if we're doing all right which is
good you know
they're very on top of their things how
was the bathroom clean
it's like they knew i was going back
there and they cleaned it it smelled
like cleaning supplies or
they just keep their bathrooms clean
yeah but let's get some boxes because i
am definitely tapping out
then we'll get our check and we'll see
what we're working with i heard curry's
better after
a couple days in the fridge well we'll
find out three days later
i can confirm this is definitely true i
gotta get my coveted shot
good luck are you guys getting your
comfort shots let us
know honestly i'm i folded i wasn't i
was against it because i heard that the
government was going to control my mind
or something but at this point
let them i need all the help i can get
honestly if they can do a better job
than i've been doing
please do me a solid thank you we
appreciate it so much
we will we will check this out guys
so we got some glab jabon and some
baklava
this is from lebanon and this is from
india let's try
first straight out of india i don't know
what this watery fluid is around it but
it almost kind of looks like a cinnamon
roll or something that's what i'm kind
of thinking it's gonna taste like
i'm gonna risk it for the biscuit
it's almost like a wet donut hole
in a way that's kind of literally the
best i can describe it
oh my god it's like they heated up the
sugar cooked the donut hole thing in it
it's literally like sugar cane
that's what this is it's like what you
feed a hummingbird last but not least
the baklava
straight out of lebanon this is i think
i've had this yeah i think i have two
and shout out to lebanon because that's
where billy's from
yeah here we go like one of those
wayfarer trips
so sweet the check is here the total is
here let's see what we're working with
keep in mind we got a lot of food so the
total is 73.27
honestly i think with what we got and
the food that we had
i think it's a good deal and i'm willing
so i can finally safely say that i am a
fan of indian food after this spot
so delicious the service was great all
the reviews are a hundred percent
correct about this place
