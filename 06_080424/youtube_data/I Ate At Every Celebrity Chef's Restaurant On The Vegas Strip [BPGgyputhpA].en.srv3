<p t="4440" d="3480">- Hello friends and
welcome to another video.</p>
<p t="7920" d="1530">This week we&#39;re gonna be eating</p>
<p t="9450" d="3180">at every celebrity chef&#39;s
restaurant on the Las Vegas strip,</p>
<p t="12630" d="2880">at Giada&#39;s, Gordon&#39;s and Guy&#39;s, oh my.</p>
<p t="15510" d="1410">Now, as some of you guys may know,</p>
<p t="16920" d="2580">earlier last year we spent
two weeks in Las Vegas,</p>
<p t="19500" d="2340">speed running staying
at every single hotel</p>
<p t="21840" d="1020">on the Vegas Strip.</p>
<p t="22860" d="2430">And while we were there
we did a lot of things</p>
<p t="25290" d="2464">like visiting the Mandalay Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p t="27754" d="3536">Oh he&#39;s a big boy.
- He&#39;s a big one.</p>
<p t="31290" d="1770">- [Safiya] Riding the terrifying Big Shot</p>
<p t="33060" d="1362">on top of the Strat.</p>
<p t="34422" d="1514">(screams)</p>
<p t="35936" d="874">(laughs)</p>
<p t="36810" d="1770">And playing &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; mini golf</p>
<p t="38580" d="1350">in the basement of Bally&#39;s.</p>
<p t="39930" d="2976">But we also had a lot of good eats.</p>
<p t="42906" d="1512">- It was a good day.</p>
<p t="44418" d="882">Yeah, more, bring it.</p>
<p t="45300" d="1650">- Vegas is generally known as a place</p>
<p t="46950" d="1260">with a lot of really great,</p>
<p t="48210" d="1950">though sometimes expensive restaurants.</p>
<p t="50160" d="2130">And in the same way that different casinos</p>
<p t="52290" d="3060">try to attract customers to
stay there with their clubs,</p>
<p t="55350" d="2910">shops and shows, they also try
and compete with each other</p>
<p t="58260" d="3150">as to who has the more
marquee places to dine.</p>
<p t="61410" d="2640">And in sort of the same way
that different famous performers</p>
<p t="64050" d="1440">have Vegas residencies,</p>
<p t="65490" d="2910">high profile celebrity chefs
have their own signature</p>
<p t="68400" d="1290">Vegas restaurants.</p>
<p t="69690" d="2310">I can take a chi latte by Guy Savoy.</p>
<p t="72000" d="2340">This has been somewhat discussed
on this channel before,</p>
<p t="74340" d="2760">but Tyler and I are big Food Network fans.</p>
<p t="77100" d="3060">Beyond the classics, we love
&quot;The Great Food Truck Race&quot;.</p>
<p t="80160" d="2550">- Let&#39;s get rolling!
(cheers)</p>
<p t="82710" d="1650">- [Safiya] As well as &quot;Food Network Star&quot;,</p>
<p t="84360" d="1560">which is basically like &quot;Top Chef&quot;,</p>
<p t="85920" d="1740">except you have to be good at cooking</p>
<p t="87660" d="2340">and good at being a TV personality.</p>
<p t="90000" d="1950">- It is the goodness, my friends.</p>
<p t="91950" d="2130">- And we also love other food related,</p>
<p t="94080" d="2340">but not actually on the Food Network shows</p>
<p t="96420" d="1920">like all of Gordon Ramsey&#39;s content.</p>
<p t="98340" d="1950">I&#39;m a particular sucker for any of the</p>
<p t="100290" d="2160">making over failing business ones.</p>
<p t="102450" d="870">- The hell is that?</p>
<p t="103320" d="1980">Looks like a (beep) flip flop.</p>
<p t="105300" d="2370">- Which makes us pretty big
fans of a lot of the names</p>
<p t="107670" d="1470">in the celebrity chef world.</p>
<p t="109140" d="1410">So while we were in Vegas,</p>
<p t="110550" d="3000">we wanted to try and hit every
celebrity chef&#39;s restaurant</p>
<p t="113550" d="2640">on the strip, get a little
taste of what they&#39;re serving up</p>
<p t="116190" d="2887">and see who generally comes out on top.</p>
<p t="119077" d="1253">&quot;Beat Bobby Flay&quot;?</p>
<p t="120330" d="1950">Well, they&#39;re all certainly gonna try.</p>
<p t="122280" d="2070">Now the first question we encountered</p>
<p t="124350" d="2580">when trying to make our list
of restaurants to hit was</p>
<p t="126930" d="1650">what is a celebrity chef?</p>
<p t="128580" d="2040">Because there are a lot
of restaurants in Vegas</p>
<p t="130620" d="1740">that boast celebrity owners.</p>
<p t="132360" d="1980">You have people who are
known for other things,</p>
<p t="134340" d="3300">like the Jonas Brothers who
just opened up a new restaurant.</p>
<p t="137640" d="1590">Are they playing Jones Brothers right now?</p>
<p t="139230" d="2310">No, it&#39;s Charlie Puth, I
think, is that allowed?</p>
<p t="141540" d="2250">And then you also have
people who are known widely</p>
<p t="143790" d="3210">for a single meme like Salt
Bae, who also has a restaurant.</p>
<p t="147000" d="2730">So when we cast a wide net
to try and make this list,</p>
<p t="149730" d="2820">we ended up with about
33 places we had to hit,</p>
<p t="152550" d="1830">which was a bit crazy when we considered</p>
<p t="154380" d="2520">that we also had to film
about three hotels a day</p>
<p t="156900" d="1260">for our other videos.</p>
<p t="158160" d="2520">So we decided to narrow
it down to just chefs</p>
<p t="160680" d="2820">who have been the central
characters in their own show,</p>
<p t="163500" d="2340">movie, or long form content series.</p>
<p t="165840" d="3300">So they are both media
personalities as well as top chefs</p>
<p t="169140" d="2850">and also the content should
be about them being chefs</p>
<p t="171990" d="1110">or running restaurants.</p>
<p t="173100" d="2280">So unfortunately the
Jonas Brothers are out.</p>
<p t="175380" d="2820">We also decided to just do
one restaurant per chef,</p>
<p t="178200" d="2340">as a lot of chefs on
this list have multiples.</p>
<p t="180540" d="2610">Gordon Ramsey has like
eight restaurants in Vegas</p>
<p t="183150" d="1890">and I feel like it&#39;s a whole other video</p>
<p t="185040" d="1560">just to go to all of his</p>
<p t="186600" d="1620">and then rank them against each other.</p>
<p t="188220" d="2970">And in the end we ended up
with a list of about 12 spots</p>
<p t="191190" d="1830">to hit, which was more doable.</p>
<p t="193020" d="1290">Now a quick note here,</p>
<p t="194310" d="2190">most of these restaurants
are pretty expensive.</p>
<p t="196500" d="3120">In general, food on the Vegas
strip can get pretty pricey,</p>
<p t="199620" d="2790">see $70 Johnny Rockets order.</p>
<p t="202410" d="2460">- That&#39;s Vegas pricing.
- That&#39;s so crazy, right?</p>
<p t="204870" d="2790">And a lot of these places
are fine dining restaurants</p>
<p t="207660" d="2730">and then when you add on
the famous name upcharge,</p>
<p t="210390" d="1290">there&#39;s even more of a bump.</p>
<p t="211680" d="2700">We will note when things are
even pricier than the rest</p>
<p t="214380" d="1560">or when things are more reasonable,</p>
<p t="215940" d="2730">but I just wanna establish
that we think that these prices</p>
<p t="218670" d="2910">are a little eye popping and
we don&#39;t usually eat like this.</p>
<p t="221580" d="3060">Also, in general, we wanted to
try a decent spread of things</p>
<p t="224640" d="900">in each restaurant.</p>
<p t="225540" d="2670">So just a heads up, we
did end up over ordering</p>
<p t="228210" d="2790">at a lot of these places and
taking the rest for later.</p>
<p t="231000" d="1860">But with that, let&#39;s dine.</p>
<p t="232860" d="1440">Now, first up on our list</p>
<p t="234300" d="3690">was David Chang&#39;s Momofuku
restaurant at The Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p t="237990" d="900">- [Tyler] Thar she blows.</p>
<p t="238890" d="833">- Oh yeah.</p>
<p t="240660" d="2700">David Chang is a famous
chef and restaurateur</p>
<p t="243360" d="3540">who opened up his first
Momofuku Noodle Bar in 2004</p>
<p t="246900" d="2400">and it became so successful
he was able to open up</p>
<p t="249300" d="3120">multiple iterations of
Momofuku&#39;s around the world.</p>
<p t="252420" d="2790">- A couple teaspoons of
salt, some black pepper,</p>
<p t="255210" d="2670">and a couple hours of don&#39;t
(beep) worry about it.</p>
<p t="257880" d="2640">- [Safiya] He also started his
own food exploration series</p>
<p t="260520" d="2070">on Netflix called &quot;Ugly Delicious&quot;.</p>
<p t="262590" d="1860">- I&#39;m okay making really ugly food.</p>
<p t="264450" d="3180">This is basically one of the
ugliest dishes I&#39;ve ever made.</p>
<p t="267630" d="1387">- [Safiya] As well as the docu-series,</p>
<p t="269017" d="1913">&quot;The Next Thing You Eat&quot; on Hulu.</p>
<p t="270930" d="2400">I think this is his main
restaurant in Vegas.</p>
<p t="273330" d="1954">- Well, you can&#39;t trust those DJs.</p>
<p t="275284" d="833">(laughs)</p>
<p t="276117" d="1353">- [Safiya] Though he
does also have a stall</p>
<p t="277470" d="1950">in this food hall at The Cosmopolitan</p>
<p t="279420" d="3090">and is a co-founder of Milk
Bar with Christina Tosi,</p>
<p t="282510" d="2130">which also has a location in The Cosmo.</p>
<p t="284640" d="3240">- Nothing gets me more worked
up than goddam pumpkin pie.</p>
<p t="287880" d="1530">- [Safiya] And the
ambiance of the restaurant</p>
<p t="289410" d="1800">is kind of like a bait and switch.</p>
<p t="291210" d="2280">The front area is a narrow wooden room,</p>
<p t="293490" d="1320">but then when you walk through it,</p>
<p t="294810" d="3360">you are let out into a huge
open dining area in the back</p>
<p t="298170" d="2640">with high ceilings and
large windows with views</p>
<p t="300810" d="1485">out onto the strip.</p>
<p t="302295" d="2688">All right, I can see the Paris behind you.</p>
<p t="304983" d="833">It&#39;s the other side.</p>
<p t="305816" d="1564">There&#39;s also some cool art in there</p>
<p t="307380" d="3060">as well as notably a
high-tech Japanese toilet,</p>
<p t="310440" d="1380">which we were so excited about</p>
<p t="311820" d="833">that Tyler
(bell dings)</p>
<p t="312653" d="1117">apparently got some footage of it.</p>
<p t="313770" d="2016">- They got a lot of good stuff.</p>
<p t="315786" d="833">- I&#39;m excited.</p>
<p t="316619" d="2551">Momofuku&#39;s cuisine is
generally described as</p>
<p t="319170" d="1800">contemporary Asian American</p>
<p t="320970" d="1800">and we basically decided to order</p>
<p t="322770" d="1560">a couple of bowls of noodles</p>
<p t="324330" d="2160">as well as some signature small plates.</p>
<p t="326490" d="2940">Now part of David Chang&#39;s
brand is pork belly buns,</p>
<p t="329430" d="1975">so we of course had to order a couple.</p>
<p t="331405" d="1475">Whoa.</p>
<p t="332880" d="833">Those are huge!</p>
<p t="333713" d="1987">And I think it&#39;s safe
to say these were good,</p>
<p t="335700" d="1620">sweet, rich and warm.</p>
<p t="337320" d="900">- That is so soft.</p>
<p t="339150" d="1380">- [Safiya] But they
weren&#39;t the standout dish</p>
<p t="340530" d="833">from our visit.</p>
<p t="341363" d="1447">We got another signature item,</p>
<p t="342810" d="2130">which our server dubbed a must try,</p>
<p t="344940" d="2490">the raw tuna with foie gras on top of it,</p>
<p t="347430" d="2820">which is kind of like a fancy
cuisine mashup kind of dish,</p>
<p t="350250" d="2310">which David Chang is
also kind of known for.</p>
<p t="352560" d="2520">- So it&#39;s like what the
(beep) are you eating?</p>
<p t="355080" d="833">You know what I mean?</p>
<p t="355913" d="1747">- Now foie gras was a new new one for me.</p>
<p t="357660" d="1110">It&#39;s made of duck liver,</p>
<p t="358770" d="2520">which just off the bat
sounded pretty intimidating,</p>
<p t="361290" d="1650">but it wasn&#39;t so bad.</p>
<p t="362940" d="1110">It kind of tastes like cheese.</p>
<p t="364050" d="2100">- [Tyler] Yeah, the goose
liver is very cheesy.</p>
<p t="366150" d="2070">- They shave it really
finely over the tuna,</p>
<p t="368220" d="3000">so the texture is a non-issue
and it&#39;s just kind of rich,</p>
<p t="371220" d="1290">savory and oily.</p>
<p t="372510" d="1740">It might be because it
looks kinda like cheese</p>
<p t="374250" d="1641">that I think it tastes like cheese,</p>
<p t="375891" d="1569">but I think it tastes like cheese.</p>
<p t="377460" d="1920">The pine nuts are good
in there though too.</p>
<p t="379380" d="2460">For our mains, we got the
ginger scallion noodles</p>
<p t="381840" d="2730">with chicken and the truffle
ramen with a poached egg,</p>
<p t="384570" d="2640">which we figured we should
try because it was $30 more</p>
<p t="387210" d="1290">than the other ramen dish.</p>
<p t="388500" d="2100">I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the
truffle down the middle.</p>
<p t="390600" d="2040">Truffle can be kind of an overpowering,</p>
<p t="392640" d="1830">earthy mushroom-esque flavor,</p>
<p t="394470" d="3222">so the broth did end up mostly
just tasting of truffle.</p>
<p t="397692" d="2936">- It&#39;s kinda like when you
have like a truffle burger</p>
<p t="400628" d="2614">or like a truffle fry in noodle form.</p>
<p t="403242" d="837">Right?</p>
<p t="404079" d="833">So like.
- It&#39;s just truffle.</p>
<p t="404912" d="2098">But Tyler really did
like the noodle itself,</p>
<p t="407010" d="1800">nice and springy, as he said.</p>
<p t="408810" d="2310">- [Tyler] I sort of like
accidentally like shotgun</p>
<p t="411120" d="960">my truffle noodles.</p>
<p t="412080" d="1860">Sorry guys, I was supposed to
get some B-roll of my noodles</p>
<p t="413940" d="900">and I ate &#39;em.</p>
<p t="414840" d="3330">- We did also get some non
signature things, mostly sides.</p>
<p t="418170" d="1710">We love spicy cucumber.</p>
<p t="419880" d="2130">And these were unexpected bangers,</p>
<p t="422010" d="3000">in particular, the Brentwood
corn was out of this world.</p>
<p t="425010" d="2340">- What are you doing?
(laughs)</p>
<p t="427350" d="1380">- I&#39;m trying to feed you the corn.</p>
<p t="428730" d="1950">It was very fresh and smokey</p>
<p t="430680" d="1590">with a little bit of salty cheese</p>
<p t="432270" d="1650">and a little tangy sauce on it.</p>
<p t="433920" d="3300">The sauce tastes like a bougie version</p>
<p t="437220" d="2280">of the Taco Bell quesadilla sauce.</p>
<p t="439500" d="1380">- Oh, I sent it this way.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="440880" d="1860">- We also ordered a yuzu lemonade,</p>
<p t="442740" d="2100">which was randomly very good.</p>
<p t="444840" d="1260">Oh, that&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="446100" d="2340">It&#39;s enhanced, that&#39;s enhanced lemonade.</p>
<p t="448440" d="2040">Yuzu is a citrus fruit from East Asia</p>
<p t="450480" d="2340">that actually popped up
a few times on our trip.</p>
<p t="452820" d="3317">- Yuzu, man, a lot of
yuzu action on this trip.</p>
<p t="456137" d="1063">- [Safiya] I agree everyone&#39;s into yuzu.</p>
<p t="457200" d="990">But in this instance,</p>
<p t="458190" d="2190">it really just deepened
the lemonade flavor.</p>
<p t="460380" d="1410">- It taste like a delicious bath bomb.</p>
<p t="461790" d="2580">- Now as for our super fast
wrap up of the restaurant</p>
<p t="464370" d="2340">so that we can get onto
the next place on our list,</p>
<p t="466710" d="1440">we liked Momofuku a lot.</p>
<p t="468150" d="3300">Is that the proper way to
eat noodles, outta my hand?</p>
<p t="471450" d="2160">Amazing corn, killer noodles.</p>
<p t="473610" d="1350">Maybe don&#39;t spring for the truffle</p>
<p t="474960" d="1920">unless you definitely like truffle.</p>
<p t="476880" d="2190">But the yuzu lemonade, once again.</p>
<p t="479070" d="2400">- Slaps.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="481470" d="1433">- It does.
- It&#39;s (beep) good.</p>
<p t="483930" d="3450">- Now next up on our list was
Gordon Ramsey&#39;s Hell&#39;s Kitchen</p>
<p t="487380" d="1290">at Caesar&#39;s Palace.</p>
<p t="488670" d="1950">- [Tyler] According to sin and cuisine.</p>
<p t="492450" d="2400">- [Safiya] And Gordon Ramsey
is probably one of the most</p>
<p t="494850" d="1770">recognizable chefs on this list,</p>
<p t="496620" d="3037">because he&#39;s made such a
name for himself in TV.</p>
<p t="499657" d="1016">- They got it wrong on the menu.</p>
<p t="500673" d="3867">It&#39;s not a crab cake, it&#39;s a crap cake.</p>
<p t="504540" d="2280">- [Safiya] Like with &quot;Kitchen
Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Master Chef&quot;,</p>
<p t="506820" d="1740">and of course &quot;Hell&#39;s Kitchen&quot;,</p>
<p t="508560" d="2820">which is a cookoff elimination
show where chefs compete</p>
<p t="511380" d="2522">to become the head chef of a restaurant.</p>
<p t="513902" d="2188">- It&#39;s (beep) raw.
(dramatic music)</p>
<p t="516090" d="1530">- [Safiya] Besides being
an accomplished chef</p>
<p t="517620" d="2220">and restaurateur, he&#39;s
also of course known</p>
<p t="519840" d="3180">for his brash personality
and prolific profanity.</p>
<p t="523020" d="2634">- Listen, listen, listen, listen.</p>
<p t="525654" d="2046">(beep) up, (beep) up, (beep)
up, (beep) up, get out!</p>
<p t="527700" d="1230">- [Safiya] As we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p t="528930" d="2280">Gordon has a ton of other
restaurants on the strip</p>
<p t="531210" d="2850">like Gordon Ramsey Steak,
Gordon Ramsey Burger,</p>
<p t="534060" d="3330">Gordon Ramsey Fish and Chips,
Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill.</p>
<p t="537390" d="1860">- [Tyler] The other
Gordon Ramsey restaurant.</p>
<p t="539250" d="2310">- But we figured Hell&#39;s
Kitchen seemed the most</p>
<p t="541560" d="2700">themed around his content,
so we picked this one.</p>
<p t="544260" d="1680">All right, ready to head into</p>
<p t="545940" d="2925">H-E double hockey stick&#39;s kitchen?</p>
<p t="548865" d="855">(laughs)</p>
<p t="549720" d="2550">Hell&#39;s Kitchen is actually
in its own free-standing</p>
<p t="552270" d="2670">structure outside the front
entrance of Caesar&#39;s Palace.</p>
<p t="554940" d="1260">And once you get inside,</p>
<p t="556200" d="2010">you are immediately hit
with a little section</p>
<p t="558210" d="2340">of Gordon merch and a digital Gordon</p>
<p t="560550" d="1860">who greets guests as they walk in.</p>
<p t="562410" d="2880">Past that is the main dining
room, which is pretty large</p>
<p t="565290" d="2910">and if you look carefully,
has a lot of devil pitchforks</p>
<p t="568200" d="900">hidden throughout.</p>
<p t="569100" d="833">They&#39;re all like back there.</p>
<p t="569933" d="1717">There are a bunch of
pitchforks back there.</p>
<p t="571650" d="1230">And is open to the kitchen,</p>
<p t="572880" d="2640">which is where I think they
literally filmed the show.</p>
<p t="575520" d="2850">And the cuisine seems to be
kind of general fine dining</p>
<p t="578370" d="2820">with a few signature
Gordon dishes thrown in.</p>
<p t="581190" d="1620">Unfortunately, idiot sandwich</p>
<p t="582810" d="947">doesn&#39;t seem to be on the menu.</p>
<p t="583757" d="1423">- [Tyler] That&#39;s a missed opportunity.</p>
<p t="585180" d="1260">- What are you?</p>
<p t="586440" d="1140">- An idiot sandwich.</p>
<p t="587580" d="1350">- We kind of ended up ordering</p>
<p t="588930" d="2130">what was on the signature tasting menu,</p>
<p t="591060" d="1320">plus a few other things.</p>
<p t="592380" d="1260">Tomato burrata salad.</p>
<p t="593640" d="1590">Fresh, never frozen scallops.</p>
<p t="595230" d="1350">Most of these were pretty good,</p>
<p t="596580" d="1740">with the exception of the scallops.</p>
<p t="598320" d="2070">We&#39;re taking you inside
the scallop here, people.</p>
<p t="600390" d="2160">The scallops themselves
were nicely cooked,</p>
<p t="602550" d="2370">but the green sauce here is pea puree</p>
<p t="604920" d="2820">and the kind of bitter pea
taste was pretty overwhelming.</p>
<p t="607740" d="1353">- There&#39;s a lot of pea in there.</p>
<p t="609093" d="1377">- It&#39;s very pea-y.</p>
<p t="610470" d="2460">And maybe they agreed
because they&#39;ve since changed</p>
<p t="612930" d="1309">their scallop dish.</p>
<p t="614239" d="1421">These might just be decorative peas.</p>
<p t="615660" d="1080">Let me ignore the peas.</p>
<p t="616740" d="2700">The burrata salad was very cool and juicy.</p>
<p t="619440" d="930">Look at that ratio.</p>
<p t="620370" d="2370">And I really liked the
cup of mushrooms I got.</p>
<p t="622740" d="3150">I&#39;m not sure what this stuff
on top is, I don&#39;t need it.</p>
<p t="625890" d="2340">I like the mushrooms just by themselves.</p>
<p t="628230" d="2940">But the thing you all and we all came for</p>
<p t="631170" d="1080">was the Wellington.</p>
<p t="632250" d="1590">Are you ready for the Beef Wellington?</p>
<p t="633840" d="990">- Well me up.</p>
<p t="634830" d="833">- Where&#39;s the Wellington?</p>
<p t="635663" d="847">I&#39;m getting nervous.</p>
<p t="636510" d="3000">- Like hell, Gordon has branded
around the Beef Wellington</p>
<p t="639510" d="1080">throughout his career.</p>
<p t="640590" d="1830">Not the Beef Wellington magnet.</p>
<p t="642420" d="2340">It&#39;s a traditional British
dish that is basically</p>
<p t="644760" d="2640">a filet steak coated
in a mushroom stuffing</p>
<p t="647400" d="2280">and then wrapped in puff pastry and baked.</p>
<p t="649680" d="2347">- [Tyler] All right I&#39;m gonna
scoop it through the potato</p>
<p t="652027" d="833">a little bit.</p>
<p t="652860" d="1500">- [Safiya] And Tyler loved this thing.</p>
<p t="654360" d="1890">- It&#39;s very fluffy.</p>
<p t="656250" d="833">- [Safiya] Fluffy?</p>
<p t="657083" d="1835">- [Tyler] It&#39;s more pastry than I thought.</p>
<p t="658918" d="1142">- Ah.
- You gotta try it.</p>
<p t="660060" d="2700">- To be fair, this is the
kind of thing Tyler likes.</p>
<p t="662760" d="2280">He likes meat pies and stuff like that.</p>
<p t="665040" d="2760">Tyler would&#39;ve done
well in medieval Europe.</p>
<p t="667800" d="2970">- Oh, yeah.
- Meat pie central, baby.</p>
<p t="670770" d="1410">- [Tyler] Except for my asthma.</p>
<p t="672180" d="2010">- And the fact that you need contacts.</p>
<p t="674190" d="1350">But between the two of us,</p>
<p t="675540" d="2460">we thought that the Beef
Wellington lived up to the hype.</p>
<p t="678000" d="1290">The meat was pretty tender</p>
<p t="679290" d="2820">and the mushroom paste was
very smooth and savory.</p>
<p t="682110" d="3690">Whatever that layer is in
between the pastry and the beef,</p>
<p t="685800" d="1350">that&#39;s very good.</p>
<p t="687150" d="2280">Now we didn&#39;t realize
this when we ordered it,</p>
<p t="689430" d="2040">but apparently the sticky toffee pudding</p>
<p t="691470" d="1830">is also a Gordon signature.</p>
<p t="693300" d="2370">I think it&#39;s based off
of his mom&#39;s recipe.</p>
<p t="695670" d="1110">What?</p>
<p t="696780" d="2460">And this ended up being pretty S-tier.</p>
<p t="699240" d="3609">That&#39;s like the best toffee,
butterscotchy-y thing</p>
<p t="702849" d="2592">I&#39;ve ever tasted in my
life, that&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="705441" d="1029">- [Tyler] Alright, lemme try, lemme try.</p>
<p t="706470" d="833">- [Safiya] Up to that point,</p>
<p t="707303" d="1897">I had thought my meal was quite good,</p>
<p t="709200" d="3300">but not mind blowing and
this dessert blew my mind.</p>
<p t="712500" d="1020">I need more of that.</p>
<p t="713520" d="1200">- [Tyler] You&#39;re trying
to speed me along here.</p>
<p t="714720" d="2040">- [Safiya] Yeah, can
you go faster, please?</p>
<p t="716760" d="4080">It&#39;s super sweet, melty,
gooey, props to Gordon&#39;s mom.</p>
<p t="720840" d="1050">- That is so good.</p>
<p t="721890" d="1258">Now that I have the spoon in my hand,</p>
<p t="723148" d="1262">I&#39;m going right back in.</p>
<p t="724410" d="1230">You got the camera, I got the spoon.</p>
<p t="725640" d="833">- How dare you.</p>
<p t="726473" d="1327">Tyler is legitimately just eating this,</p>
<p t="727800" d="1230">so I&#39;m gonna have to put the camera down</p>
<p t="729030" d="1170">if I want another bite.</p>
<p t="730200" d="2760">Now overall, we enjoyed
our experience here,</p>
<p t="732960" d="1830">at least somewhat for the novelty,</p>
<p t="734790" d="2670">but I would definitely bring
another Gordon fan here</p>
<p t="737460" d="1470">to try the toffee pudding.</p>
<p t="738930" d="2370">If loving that is illegal, lock me up.</p>
<p t="741300" d="1950">That&#39;s amazing, what the hell?</p>
<p t="743250" d="2790">And possibly buy a Beef Wellington magnet.</p>
<p t="746040" d="2070">It&#39;s not a want, it&#39;s a need.</p>
<p t="748110" d="3540">Now next up on our list was
Tom Colicchio&#39;s Heritage Steak</p>
<p t="751650" d="1140">at the Mirage.</p>
<p t="752790" d="1950">- This challenge really epitomizes
what I think about food.</p>
<p t="754740" d="1950">Simple things have to be done right.</p>
<p t="756690" d="1860">- [Safiya] Tom Colicchio
is I think best known</p>
<p t="758550" d="2220">for being the head judge
of the long-running</p>
<p t="760770" d="2670">competition show &quot;Top Chef&quot; on Bravo.</p>
<p t="763440" d="3600">- In this business one day
you&#39;re in, the next you&#39;re out.</p>
<p t="767040" d="1200">- [Safiya] That&#39;s not &quot;Top Chef&quot;.</p>
<p t="768240" d="3090">But he has hosted and appeared
in other content as well.</p>
<p t="771330" d="2880">- How about we play a
little game of chicken?</p>
<p t="774210" d="1650">- [Safiya] Besides being
an accomplished chef</p>
<p t="775860" d="2820">and restaurateur, I also read
an article that called him</p>
<p t="778680" d="3060">a master with the meat, so
with that what you will.</p>
<p t="781740" d="1620">- That&#39;s the way I do it.</p>
<p t="783360" d="1050">That&#39;s not the way I do it.</p>
<p t="784410" d="1410">- Well this is like the
first one that we&#39;ve gone to</p>
<p t="785820" d="1889">that is a steakhouse.</p>
<p t="787709" d="1931">- So you have to get a steak.
- We gotta get streak.</p>
<p t="789640" d="1940">- [Safiya] And I think he
has two restaurants in Vegas.</p>
<p t="791580" d="2580">He also has Craft Steak at the MGM Grand.</p>
<p t="794160" d="2160">But because we already
had multiple restaurants</p>
<p t="796320" d="2070">to visit over there, we went for this one,</p>
<p t="798390" d="2580">which is right in the
central atrium of the Mirage</p>
<p t="800970" d="1410">next to the casino floor.</p>
<p t="802380" d="3090">And it also has a bit of
a hidden back area concept</p>
<p t="805470" d="2490">as there&#39;s this whole
big dining room back here</p>
<p t="807960" d="2970">kind of behind the waterfall
in the middle of the hotel.</p>
<p t="810930" d="1200">Yeah, there&#39;s a whole thing back here.</p>
<p t="812130" d="833">- Yeah.</p>
<p t="812963" d="1117">- So it&#39;s sort of like you&#39;re dining</p>
<p t="814080" d="2490">in a little tropical
bungalow, which is nice.</p>
<p t="816570" d="2459">I am like lost in the
jungle right now, aren&#39;t I?</p>
<p t="819029" d="833">(laughs)</p>
<p t="819862" d="848">And as we mentioned,</p>
<p t="820710" d="2730">Tom mostly focuses on steakhouse classics</p>
<p t="823440" d="1560">with some seafood thrown in,</p>
<p t="825000" d="1830">though they do note that
they cook their meats</p>
<p t="826830" d="2700">on a white oak open fire, fancy.</p>
<p t="829530" d="3540">On the seafood side, we did
get the raw yellowtail crudo.</p>
<p t="833070" d="1350">- [Tyler] Yeah, that&#39;s
a pretty presentation.</p>
<p t="834420" d="2130">If you think about it, like a
&quot;Top Chef&quot; presentation&#39;s big,</p>
<p t="836550" d="833">right?</p>
<p t="837383" d="1087">Is that the one they put
their hands up, right?</p>
<p t="838470" d="1830">- They all do that.
- Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="840300" d="2130">- Which looked great, but tasted okay.</p>
<p t="842430" d="1710">A little too much skin for my taste.</p>
<p t="844140" d="1200">And on the steak side,</p>
<p t="845340" d="1560">because of course we had to get a steak,</p>
<p t="846900" d="1920">we ordered the bone-in ribeye.</p>
<p t="848820" d="2670">We asked, that&#39;s their top selling steak.</p>
<p t="851490" d="2100">And this clearly was a high end steak.</p>
<p t="853590" d="1230">- It&#39;s damn good.</p>
<p t="854820" d="1830">- It wasn&#39;t too thick or too rich,</p>
<p t="856650" d="2760">so it was pretty easy to eat
and you could kind of taste</p>
<p t="859410" d="2130">the char from the open flame actually.</p>
<p t="861540" d="1747">I like how smokey it is.</p>
<p t="863287" d="953">- [Tyler] It&#39;s very smokey.</p>
<p t="864240" d="1830">- [Safiya] However, I have to be honest,</p>
<p t="866070" d="3000">we don&#39;t know a lot about
how to judge good steaks.</p>
<p t="869070" d="2550">There are people out there who
are like steak connoisseurs</p>
<p t="871620" d="2070">and can describe subtle differences.</p>
<p t="873690" d="2970">And we are more like if a
steak meets a minimum standard,</p>
<p t="876660" d="2310">it&#39;s good, but we can judge other things.</p>
<p t="878970" d="2790">And we found that the real
standouts were the sides</p>
<p t="881760" d="2730">and the free stuff, the fries, awesome.</p>
<p t="884490" d="1920">Okay, I snuck a fry, they&#39;re amazing.</p>
<p t="886410" d="840">- [Tyler] It&#39;s pretty incredible.</p>
<p t="887250" d="1920">- [Safiya] They&#39;re like
gourmet McDonald&#39;s fries.</p>
<p t="889170" d="960">- Yeah, they are.</p>
<p t="890130" d="2160">- The mixed green salad, beefy.</p>
<p t="892290" d="2250">That cucumber could eat your mom.</p>
<p t="894540" d="1530">The complimentary rolls?</p>
<p t="896070" d="2850">Whoa, delectable.</p>
<p t="898920" d="1710">Those look like luscious butt cheeks.</p>
<p t="900630" d="1858">And the chill tomato
gazpacho was a standout dish</p>
<p t="902488" d="2220">for the entire trip, it was tangy.</p>
<p t="904708" d="2582">There were little quinoa pieces in there</p>
<p t="907290" d="1290">that made it kind of crunchy.</p>
<p t="908580" d="2280">And there were also large
pieces of what I thought</p>
<p t="910860" d="1680">were very firm cucumber.</p>
<p t="912540" d="3510">But upon further inspection,
there&#39;s watermelon in there.</p>
<p t="916050" d="1080">- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="917130" d="1050">Which was genius.</p>
<p t="918180" d="4740">It was sweet, crisp,
watery, very top shelf.</p>
<p t="922920" d="833">Get it?</p>
<p t="923753" d="833">Like &quot;Top Chef&quot;.</p>
<p t="924586" d="1094">- [Tyler] You look like
you&#39;re telling a story</p>
<p t="925680" d="2080">on &quot;Are You Afraid the Dark&quot; right now.</p>
<p t="927760" d="1400">- It&#39;s watermelon.</p>
<p t="929160" d="1740">Overall, we had a good time.</p>
<p t="930900" d="1560">I would come back for the gazpacho</p>
<p t="932460" d="3360">and the bootylicious
rolls, whoa, what the heck?</p>
<p t="935820" d="2520">But unfortunately, the
Mirage is set to be replaced</p>
<p t="938340" d="2850">with a giant hard rock
guitar shaped casino,</p>
<p t="941190" d="1500">so I might not get the chance.</p>
<p t="942690" d="1950">Now the next restaurant on our list was</p>
<p t="944640" d="2760">Jose Andres&#39; Bazaar Meats at the Sahara.</p>
<p t="947400" d="3377">- Hello people, I am Jose Andres.</p>
<p t="950777" d="1183">Oh yeah.</p>
<p t="951960" d="2220">- [Safiya] Jose Andres
is a famous Spanish chef</p>
<p t="954180" d="3240">who&#39;s been credited with helping
popularize the tapas style</p>
<p t="957420" d="2370">small dish dining concept in America</p>
<p t="959790" d="1860">during the nineties and 2000s.</p>
<p t="961650" d="990">- Let&#39;s go to the kitchen.</p>
<p t="962640" d="2490">- [Safiya] As his restaurants
in the US became more popular,</p>
<p t="965130" d="2580">he started becoming more
famous in Spain as well</p>
<p t="967710" d="2220">and got his own show on Spanish TV.</p>
<p t="969930" d="3660">- The pasta obviously was
invented in Spain, period, yes.</p>
<p t="973590" d="2130">- [Safiya] He&#39;s also been
featured in a documentary film</p>
<p t="975720" d="3390">about his nonprofit World
Central Kitchen on Disney Plus.</p>
<p t="979110" d="2340">And he also has a new Discovery plus show</p>
<p t="981450" d="1401">coming out as well.</p>
<p t="982851" d="2079">- It&#39;s like an art piece.
- It&#39;s an art piece.</p>
<p t="984930" d="2400">- And Jose Andres actually
has a lot of restaurants</p>
<p t="987330" d="2400">on the Vegas strip, but
we chose Bazaar Meats</p>
<p t="989730" d="3360">because it combines some elements
of the Spanish tapa style</p>
<p t="993090" d="2760">with cuts of rare meat
and some of his out there,</p>
<p t="995850" d="3000">experimental molecular gastronomy dishes.</p>
<p t="998850" d="3630">What is a caviar cone and do we need it?</p>
<p t="1002480" d="2760">The restaurant itself
is like a long dark room</p>
<p t="1005240" d="3120">with bizarre, almost
hunting lodge type decor.</p>
<p t="1008360" d="2040">- [Tyler] A lot of antlers.</p>
<p t="1010400" d="960">An alligator.</p>
<p t="1011360" d="2610">- Also the kitchen is
open to the dining room</p>
<p t="1013970" d="2910">and so a lot of smoke from
different grilling meats</p>
<p t="1016880" d="900">fills the air.</p>
<p t="1017780" d="2730">The thing is is it just,
it smells so good in here,</p>
<p t="1020510" d="1200">it&#39;s hard to get over it.</p>
<p t="1021710" d="1560">Now there&#39;s a lot on this menu</p>
<p t="1023270" d="2520">and a lot of our choices
were directed by our server.</p>
<p t="1025790" d="2250">And since most of it is tapas style,</p>
<p t="1028040" d="2790">we ordered a lot of
stuff including a smoking</p>
<p t="1030830" d="2973">cotton candy mojito because
we saw someone else get it.</p>
<p t="1033803" d="957">Is that how you drink it, Tyler</p>
<p t="1034760" d="833">you just stick your head in it?</p>
<p t="1035593" d="1507">- Yeah.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1037100" d="1230">- [Safiya] The majority of dishes</p>
<p t="1038330" d="2010">fall into three main categories.</p>
<p t="1040340" d="2580">The raw stuff like the bison carpaccio,</p>
<p t="1042920" d="2250">this is literally meat by the foot.</p>
<p t="1045170" d="1020">This is how you do it.</p>
<p t="1046190" d="1770">As well as the Kobe airbreads,</p>
<p t="1047960" d="2820">which are like hollow
crackers with raw meat outside</p>
<p t="1050780" d="1740">and liquid cheese inside.</p>
<p t="1052520" d="1560">- [Tyler] This one&#39;s like a cheese steak.</p>
<p t="1054080" d="1260">- [Safiya] A raw cheese steak?</p>
<p t="1055340" d="3460">The tiny stuff like this
deconstructed caprese salad.</p>
<p t="1058800" d="833">- [Tyler] Well it&#39;s the size of the plate</p>
<p t="1059633" d="867">that does it for me.</p>
<p t="1060500" d="1320">- And the caviar cones,</p>
<p t="1061820" d="2610">which at the risk of
sounding highly unrelatable,</p>
<p t="1064430" d="1800">I actually thought were pretty good.</p>
<p t="1066230" d="2880">Kind of tastes like a
wonton with cheese in it.</p>
<p t="1069110" d="1650">Nice, crunchy and salty.</p>
<p t="1070760" d="2243">And this one even had
some gold flakes on it.</p>
<p t="1073003" d="1628">- I love gold.</p>
<p t="1074631" d="1450">Can I eat it?
- Yes you can.</p>
<p t="1077660" d="870">- That&#39;s delicious.</p>
<p t="1078530" d="2010">- [Safiya] And then we have
the experimental stuff,</p>
<p t="1080540" d="2670">like these deconstructed
olives, which were pretty crazy.</p>
<p t="1083210" d="2040">- [Server] Now this right
here is an experience.</p>
<p t="1085250" d="1560">- [Safiya] They serve you real olives</p>
<p t="1086810" d="1950">and then like the essence of an olive</p>
<p t="1088760" d="1600">in a little sack of water.</p>
<p t="1090360" d="1160">It looks like an egg yolk.</p>
<p t="1091520" d="2040">- It is Gudetama-esque.
- Oh my god, oh my god,</p>
<p t="1093560" d="833">it&#39;s sliding around.
- All right,</p>
<p t="1094393" d="833">go, go, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p t="1095226" d="1817">- Just slide it in?
- Slide it in.</p>
<p t="1097043" d="833">Slide it down your gullet.</p>
<p t="1097876" d="2344">- Which you pop in your mouth
and kind of tastes like the</p>
<p t="1100220" d="1950">aftertaste of a veggie pizza.</p>
<p t="1102170" d="2010">If pizza was water.</p>
<p t="1104180" d="833">It was pretty good.</p>
<p t="1105013" d="2107">Obviously a pizza with olives, but still.</p>
<p t="1107120" d="2280">The other marquee
experimental thing we got</p>
<p t="1109400" d="1890">was the foie gras cotton candy,</p>
<p t="1111290" d="2520">which as we mentioned before is duck liver</p>
<p t="1113810" d="2820">that is in this case
somehow spun into sugar.</p>
<p t="1116630" d="1192">- Cheers.
- One bite, one bite.</p>
<p t="1117822" d="1058">- Cheers, all in one bite, yeah, ready?</p>
<p t="1118880" d="1470">- [Safiya] I thought this was interesting.</p>
<p t="1120350" d="833">- [Tyler] Cheesy.</p>
<p t="1121183" d="2407">- The cotton candy part
itself was almost just like</p>
<p t="1123590" d="1080">normal cotton candy,</p>
<p t="1124670" d="2220">but there was a bit of
more solid foie gras</p>
<p t="1126890" d="2906">in the middle of it that
kind of took me by surprise.</p>
<p t="1129796" d="1671">It was like cotton candy until it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="1131467" d="2805">It was almost like a pad
of butter in the middle.</p>
<p t="1134272" d="2608">I don&#39;t know if I liked it, I think.</p>
<p t="1136880" d="3150">We did also order a very
small amount of a rare cut</p>
<p t="1140030" d="2430">of Wagyu beef, which was
cooked on a hot stone</p>
<p t="1142460" d="1185">next to our table.</p>
<p t="1143645" d="1595">I feel a little wined and dined right now.</p>
<p t="1145240" d="2650">I feel very like catered
to, you know what I mean?</p>
<p t="1147890" d="2490">So the whole experience
was very impressive.</p>
<p t="1150380" d="1680">- [Tyler] It was the
certificate of authenticity</p>
<p t="1152060" d="2040">that did it for you?
- Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p t="1154100" d="1560">It&#39;s the certificate for me.</p>
<p t="1155660" d="2580">And it was actually a good thing
that we got so little of it</p>
<p t="1158240" d="1620">because it was extremely rich,</p>
<p t="1159860" d="2369">so I don&#39;t think we could
have eaten much more.</p>
<p t="1162229" d="1561">- It&#39;s the least laborous
beef I&#39;ve ever eaten.</p>
<p t="1163790" d="900">It just melts.</p>
<p t="1164690" d="2220">- [Safiya] We did also get
an assortment of desserts.</p>
<p t="1166910" d="833">What the heck?</p>
<p t="1167743" d="1867">- [Tyler] I&#39;m a little
rattled by how good they look.</p>
<p t="1169610" d="1530">- [Safiya] Which weren&#39;t
that experimental,</p>
<p t="1171140" d="1800">but they were incredible.</p>
<p t="1172940" d="2160">- [Tyler] That went straight to the face.</p>
<p t="1175100" d="2040">- [Safiya] Now we did say we
would mention if a restaurant</p>
<p t="1177140" d="2010">was more expensive than the others</p>
<p t="1179150" d="1950">and that restaurant is this one.</p>
<p t="1181100" d="2610">I think partially because
it&#39;s fancy small plates</p>
<p t="1183710" d="2580">and partially because
it&#39;s cuts of rare meats,</p>
<p t="1186290" d="1380">but I would come back</p>
<p t="1187670" d="1710">if someone else was picking up the bill</p>
<p t="1189380" d="2820">for the caviar cones and the desserts.</p>
<p t="1192200" d="1230">- It&#39;s the tits.</p>
<p t="1193430" d="2550">- [Safiya] Now next up on
our list was Bobby Flay&#39;s</p>
<p t="1195980" d="1980">Bobby&#39;s Burgers at Harrah&#39;s.</p>
<p t="1197960" d="1620">- [Tyler] Bobby&#39;s Burgers.</p>
<p t="1199580" d="1470">- [Safiya] That&#39;s where we&#39;re going!</p>
<p t="1201050" d="3447">Bobby Flay is a longtime
Food Network personality.</p>
<p t="1204497" d="1983">- [Tyler] There he is, man with the plan.</p>
<p t="1206480" d="1140">- [Safiya] Having cooked and judged</p>
<p t="1207620" d="2400">on like a million different
Food Network shows.</p>
<p t="1210020" d="1350">- Enough said.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1211370" d="1680">- But he might be best known for his own</p>
<p t="1213050" d="2730">personal competition
show, &quot;Beat Bobby Flay&quot;.</p>
<p t="1215780" d="2633">- What happened?
- I just shut his oven off.</p>
<p t="1218413" d="833">(laughs)</p>
<p t="1219246" d="1364">- [Safiya] And though
he does a lot of stuff,</p>
<p t="1220610" d="1560">he specializes in Cajun</p>
<p t="1222170" d="2310">and southwestern cuisine specifically.</p>
<p t="1224480" d="2220">- Woo.
- It&#39;s hot.</p>
<p t="1226700" d="833">It&#39;s a hot sauce.</p>
<p t="1227533" d="1417">- [Safiya] Now some drama.</p>
<p t="1228950" d="2850">Before the pandemic, Tyler
and I had visited Vegas</p>
<p t="1231800" d="3060">and seen Bobby Flay&#39;s Mesa
Grill at Caesar&#39;s Palace,</p>
<p t="1234860" d="2850">which is his OG restaurant
brand that he opened in New York</p>
<p t="1237710" d="900">in the nineties.</p>
<p t="1238610" d="3210">And for some reason we were
very excited by this idea.</p>
<p t="1241820" d="3480">- [Tyler] Mesa, Bobby Flay&#39;s Mesa Grill.</p>
<p t="1245300" d="2940">- But lo and behold, when we
returned to Vegas this year,</p>
<p t="1248240" d="3060">it seemed that Bobby had
replaced his iconic Mesa grill</p>
<p t="1251300" d="2760">with a coastal Italian restaurant, Amalfi</p>
<p t="1254060" d="2520">and Tyler and I felt irrationally betrayed</p>
<p t="1256580" d="1980">that we would never get
to eat at Mesa Grill.</p>
<p t="1258560" d="2040">I had no impulse to Beat Bobby Flay</p>
<p t="1260600" d="1950">until you removed Mesa Grill.</p>
<p t="1262550" d="1230">Now I wanna beat him to a pulp.</p>
<p t="1263780" d="2670">So we could not bring
ourselves to go to Amalfi.</p>
<p t="1266450" d="1986">- [Tyler] Look, it looks super nice.</p>
<p t="1268436" d="1311">- [Safiya] No, don&#39;t say that.</p>
<p t="1269747" d="1413">- [Tyler] But in terms of decor.</p>
<p t="1271160" d="1140">- Literally never speak to me again.</p>
<p t="1272300" d="1050">I can&#39;t believe you said that.</p>
<p t="1273350" d="2730">Instead we decided to go
to one of Bobby Flay&#39;s</p>
<p t="1276080" d="1650">Bobby&#39;s Burgers locations</p>
<p t="1277730" d="2340">and Bobby does seem to be
opening a lot of these,</p>
<p t="1280070" d="2340">so they seem to be a point
of emphasis for him as well.</p>
<p t="1282410" d="1470">- [Tyler] People like Bobby&#39;s Burgers.</p>
<p t="1283880" d="2790">- It&#39;s a decently casual
walkup burger spot,</p>
<p t="1286670" d="3270">which I would describe as a
more gourmet seeming Five Guys</p>
<p t="1289940" d="1200">or Shake Shack.</p>
<p t="1291140" d="2213">Oh, should I have gotten the fries?</p>
<p t="1293353" d="833">- [Tyler] Go back and get us some fries.</p>
<p t="1294186" d="1227">- We gotta get some fries.
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="1295413" d="833">- Okay.</p>
<p t="1296246" d="1854">And his menu is of course mostly burgers,</p>
<p t="1298100" d="2383">but like with interesting toppings.</p>
<p t="1300483" d="1397">I should wait.</p>
<p t="1301880" d="1890">His Crunch Burger is trademarked,</p>
<p t="1303770" d="1560">so of course we had to get that.</p>
<p t="1305330" d="1170">And the secret of this one</p>
<p t="1306500" d="2850">is that they put a bunch of
potato chips on the burger.</p>
<p t="1309350" d="2460">That did sound crunchy, I&#39;m not gonna lie.</p>
<p t="1311810" d="1800">The crunch heard around the Harrah&#39;s.</p>
<p t="1313610" d="2220">But beyond that, it is pretty tasty.</p>
<p t="1315830" d="2550">That tastes very bad for me.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1318380" d="2040">I think because of the lack of vegetables,</p>
<p t="1320420" d="1440">it is a bit heavy feeling</p>
<p t="1321860" d="3360">like it&#39;s meat, cheese,
bread and salty chips.</p>
<p t="1325220" d="900">It&#39;s a knockout.</p>
<p t="1326120" d="3330">It almost has like a Hamburger
Helper, mac and cheese vibe.</p>
<p t="1329450" d="2310">The second thing we got
was the brunch burger,</p>
<p t="1331760" d="2370">partially because it rhymed and
partially because we thought</p>
<p t="1334130" d="1940">it was just an egg sandwich.
(bell chimes)</p>
<p t="1336070" d="833">Are you gonna lift it up?</p>
<p t="1336903" d="1040">Oh, hello there.</p>
<p t="1339046" d="1624">- [Tyler] That is a beautiful little egg.</p>
<p t="1340670" d="2130">- As big egg fans, we did like it.</p>
<p t="1342800" d="2220">Once again, it&#39;s like very cozy.</p>
<p t="1345020" d="2100">But in my opinion it was sorely lacking</p>
<p t="1347120" d="3240">a little crisp tomato or maybe
a raw onion or something.</p>
<p t="1350360" d="2100">Absolutely no vegetables at all,</p>
<p t="1352460" d="1560">not a single one to be found.</p>
<p t="1354020" d="2220">That said, the fried
chicken sandwich we got</p>
<p t="1356240" d="1170">was really good.</p>
<p t="1357410" d="2250">The textures in here
were a little more varied</p>
<p t="1359660" d="3450">with some crispy cabbage slaw
and a little vinegary pickle.</p>
<p t="1363110" d="1770">There&#39;s something a
little spicy in the slaw,</p>
<p t="1364880" d="1530">which is giving it to me.</p>
<p t="1366410" d="1680">- The pickle is out this world.</p>
<p t="1368090" d="2790">- And all that helped balance
out the fried chicken itself</p>
<p t="1370880" d="2040">for a great sandwich experience.</p>
<p t="1372920" d="2220">Something a little fresher about this one.</p>
<p t="1375140" d="1980">Probably the vegetables.
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="1377120" d="2520">- [Safiya] Okay, so it&#39;s not
completely fair to compare</p>
<p t="1379640" d="2820">Bobby&#39;s Burgers to the other
fine dining restaurants,</p>
<p t="1382460" d="2490">but overall I thought
some of his burger ideas</p>
<p t="1384950" d="1170">were pretty interesting.</p>
<p t="1386120" d="1860">- [Tyler] Would you say that
it has the trademark edge</p>
<p t="1387980" d="2100">of Bobby&#39;s personality?
- Yes.</p>
<p t="1390080" d="840">- Shut up.</p>
<p t="1390920" d="3000">- And these three burgers
were actually less expensive</p>
<p t="1393920" d="1380">than the three chicken sandwiches</p>
<p t="1395300" d="1470">we bought from Johnny Rockets.</p>
<p t="1396770" d="3030">So even though it&#39;s not
cheap, it is cheaper.</p>
<p t="1399800" d="2820">Now next up on our list
was Buddy Valastro&#39;s</p>
<p t="1402620" d="2430">Pizza Cake restaurant, also at Harrah&#39;s.</p>
<p t="1405050" d="2160">We&#39;re knocking out a bunch
of celebrity chef restaurants</p>
<p t="1407210" d="1050">like right now.</p>
<p t="1408260" d="3000">Buddy V is more commonly
known as the Cake Boss.</p>
<p t="1411260" d="1560">- There&#39;s a lot of cake here, man.</p>
<p t="1412820" d="2370">- [Safiya] Famous from
the long-running TLC show</p>
<p t="1415190" d="3330">that chronicles the crazy
creations he and his staff make</p>
<p t="1418520" d="3510">at their family run Carlo&#39;s
Bakery in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>
<p t="1422030" d="1650">- That&#39;s how you do a dragon cake</p>
<p t="1423680" d="1890">Hoboken style.
(bell chimes)</p>
<p t="1425570" d="1740">Hoboken style.
(bell chimes)</p>
<p t="1427310" d="2070">Hoboken style, baby.
(bell chimes)</p>
<p t="1429380" d="2250">- [Safiya] And like we
mentioned in our hotel video,</p>
<p t="1431630" d="2310">Buddy V is kind of taking over the strip.</p>
<p t="1433940" d="1470">- Big time, baby.
(bell chimes)</p>
<p t="1435410" d="2550">- In addition to having a number of 24/7</p>
<p t="1437960" d="2640">cake vending machines all over the place,</p>
<p t="1440600" d="2370">He has a Buddy&#39;s
Ristorante at The Venetian,</p>
<p t="1442970" d="1710">a Boss Cafe at The Linq</p>
<p t="1444680" d="3150">and then a Buddy&#39;s Jersey
Eats also at The Linq.</p>
<p t="1447830" d="1560">Another Buddy Valastro restaurant.</p>
<p t="1449390" d="2250">- [Tyler] He&#39;s got a lot of juice.</p>
<p t="1451640" d="1740">- [Safiya] I chose Pizza Cake specifically</p>
<p t="1453380" d="3330">because it sounded more cake
oriented and also because</p>
<p t="1456710" d="2070">there was a time where Buddy actually made</p>
<p t="1458780" d="1497">a giant pizza cake on the show.</p>
<p t="1460277" d="2223">- Now that&#39;s a pizza cake.</p>
<p t="1462500" d="1350">Woohoo!</p>
<p t="1463850" d="960">- [Safiya] Pretty impressive.</p>
<p t="1464810" d="1260">- [Tyler] Do you think the name Pizza Cake</p>
<p t="1466070" d="1290">is supposed to be like piece a cake?</p>
<p t="1467360" d="2760">- Oh, that&#39;s pretty good.</p>
<p t="1470120" d="2640">Pizza Cake is right next to
the Harrah&#39;s casino floor</p>
<p t="1472760" d="2790">and is pretty open to
the rest of the hotel.</p>
<p t="1475550" d="1470">Let&#39;s make some dough!</p>
<p t="1477020" d="1890">That&#39;s what he&#39;s making here in Vegas.</p>
<p t="1478910" d="1560">And as the name suggests,</p>
<p t="1480470" d="2010">they serve different pizzas by the slice</p>
<p t="1482480" d="3180">as well as slices of cakes,
cookies and cannolis.</p>
<p t="1485660" d="2910">Whoa, what should we do?
- I dunno.</p>
<p t="1488570" d="2190">- [Safiya] Already weighed
down by Bobby&#39;s Burgers,</p>
<p t="1490760" d="2850">we skipped past the pizza and
went straight for dessert.</p>
<p t="1493610" d="2040">We ordered a slice of the rainbow cake,</p>
<p t="1495650" d="3180">which disappointingly did come
out of the vending machine.</p>
<p t="1498830" d="3090">I&#39;ve never had cake like this before.</p>
<p t="1501920" d="1020">- [Tyler] What, vacuum sealed?</p>
<p t="1502940" d="2178">- So I guess we could have just gone</p>
<p t="1505118" d="2052">to one of the vending machines,
but it was pretty good.</p>
<p t="1507170" d="2340">The frosting was a little
too sweet for my taste,</p>
<p t="1509510" d="2730">but the cake part itself
was really light and fluffy</p>
<p t="1512240" d="1080">and a little eggy.</p>
<p t="1513320" d="1976">Let&#39;s carve out the frosting.
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="1515296" d="844">Elightened thinking.</p>
<p t="1516140" d="3124">- [Safiya] We also got a slice
of these s&#39;mores cookie cake.</p>
<p t="1519264" d="2006">Oh my god there are
teddy grahams on there.</p>
<p t="1521270" d="1020">- [Tyler] That&#39;s what sold it to me.</p>
<p t="1522290" d="2010">- [Safiya] Which I had gotten
because it seemed the most</p>
<p t="1524300" d="1710">like a cake pizza.</p>
<p t="1526010" d="3900">- Marshmallows, teddy
grahams, chocolate, good!</p>
<p t="1529910" d="1650">- The cookie itself was nice</p>
<p t="1531560" d="2550">and the use of teddy grahams
was kind of inspired.</p>
<p t="1534110" d="2490">But my one gripe was that they once again</p>
<p t="1536600" d="1890">used a lot of really sweet frosting.</p>
<p t="1538490" d="1944">Is there icing on there?</p>
<p t="1540434" d="1236">I feel like there doesn&#39;t need to be.</p>
<p t="1541670" d="840">- No.
- And then</p>
<p t="1542510" d="2640">we also got a cannoli,
which was excellent.</p>
<p t="1545150" d="990">Here it is.</p>
<p t="1546140" d="1740">The shell was nice and crispy</p>
<p t="1547880" d="2220">and the cream filling was not too sweet.</p>
<p t="1550100" d="3210">It was that perfect kind of
light cream cheesy flavor.</p>
<p t="1553310" d="1080">That&#39;s my favorite.</p>
<p t="1554390" d="2340">If I were Buddy, I would
be vacuum sealing these</p>
<p t="1556730" d="2160">and putting them in the
vending machines too.</p>
<p t="1558890" d="1920">How&#39;s it going over there, cannoli boy?</p>
<p t="1560810" d="3466">- Bigger bite than I was
expecting, welcomed though.</p>
<p t="1564276" d="1574">- Really good, right?
- Really good.</p>
<p t="1565850" d="2370">- [Safiya] Once again, it&#39;s
not that fair to compare this</p>
<p t="1568220" d="1740">to other fine dining restaurants,</p>
<p t="1569960" d="2670">but as a casual spot
next to the casino floor,</p>
<p t="1572630" d="1500">I thought this place was pretty fun.</p>
<p t="1574130" d="1470">The cannoli was the tits</p>
<p t="1575600" d="2550">and you do have to tip
your hat to Buddy V.</p>
<p t="1578150" d="1380">He&#39;s building an empire</p>
<p t="1579530" d="2550">and there&#39;s nothing any
of us can do to stop him.</p>
<p t="1582080" d="1250">- You&#39;re always eating
on the job, come on,</p>
<p t="1583330" d="1390">get back to work.</p>
<p t="1584720" d="2790">- Later that same day,
thankfully a few hours later,</p>
<p t="1587510" d="1590">so we had some time to digest,</p>
<p t="1589100" d="3090">we headed over to Guy Fieri&#39;s
restaurant at the Linq.</p>
<p t="1592190" d="3333">First impressions of The
Linq, smells like barbecue.</p>
<p t="1595523" d="1137">Guy Fieri&#39;s restaurant?</p>
<p t="1596660" d="1080">Right there.</p>
<p t="1597740" d="1238">Coincidence?</p>
<p t="1598978" d="1132">I think not.</p>
<p t="1600110" d="2250">Quick disclaimer, I say Guy Fieri&#39;s name</p>
<p t="1602360" d="2340">like 85 different ways in this video,</p>
<p t="1604700" d="3060">I apologize and hope I am
saying it correctly now.</p>
<p t="1607760" d="2490">- Now what comes rolling
down the driveway for dinner,</p>
<p t="1610250" d="2580">but this, the super duper weenie wagon.</p>
<p t="1612830" d="2310">- [Safiya] Now Guy Fieri,
with his off the hook</p>
<p t="1615140" d="2670">California cuisine was
actually an early winner</p>
<p t="1617810" d="3600">of Food Network Star back in
2006 and has since then become</p>
<p t="1621410" d="2973">one of the most recognizable
faces of the network.</p>
<p t="1625315" d="1375">- Wow, that&#39;s good.</p>
<p t="1626690" d="2580">The sausage ratio to this is outstanding.</p>
<p t="1629270" d="3120">- [Safiya] He&#39;s known for his
iconic style, frosted tips,</p>
<p t="1632390" d="1350">rough and tumble vibes,</p>
<p t="1633740" d="3030">and for being the self-proclaimed
mayor of Flavortown.</p>
<p t="1636770" d="923">- Are we in Flavortown right now?</p>
<p t="1637693" d="1957">- I am at customs.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1639650" d="1320">I am crossing the border.</p>
<p t="1640970" d="900">You know what this is?</p>
<p t="1641870" d="2670">This is the Punch Bowl at the
Flavortown high school prom.</p>
<p t="1644540" d="2430">- We were also wearing
these coordinated, flaming</p>
<p t="1646970" d="2760">bowling shirts in celebration
of going to his restaurant.</p>
<p t="1649730" d="1406">So we were pumped.</p>
<p t="1651136" d="2914">I&#39;m going to Flavortown
and no one can stop me.</p>
<p t="1654050" d="2250">I think this is his only
restaurant in Vegas,</p>
<p t="1656300" d="2700">though he does seem to
operate a Flavortown Kitchen,</p>
<p t="1659000" d="2130">which is a delivery only ghost kitchen.</p>
<p t="1661130" d="2610">I guess that answers my
question as to why this place</p>
<p t="1663740" d="1380">isn&#39;t called Flavortown.</p>
<p t="1665120" d="1920">- [Tyler] It&#39;s Guy Fieri&#39;s Vegas.</p>
<p t="1667040" d="833">- That&#39;s an awful name.</p>
<p t="1667873" d="3127">But I still think he could
consider Flavor Sin City</p>
<p t="1671000" d="1350">or Flavortown Two.</p>
<p t="1672350" d="2700">Two Flavor Two City.</p>
<p t="1675050" d="1413">- Flavor Seven.
- Yes.</p>
<p t="1677390" d="3540">And he&#39;s serving up saucy
twists on American comfort food</p>
<p t="1680930" d="2340">with a lot of pretty crazy sounding names.</p>
<p t="1683270" d="2820">The Trashcan nachos are
one of his signature dishes</p>
<p t="1686090" d="1443">that we had to try, ah!</p>
<p t="1689060" d="3120">And they were pretty impressive
in terms of presentation,</p>
<p t="1692180" d="2070">quantity and tang.</p>
<p t="1694250" d="1300">- There&#39;s a lot of flavor.</p>
<p t="1696500" d="1680">That pickled onion&#39;s not messing around.</p>
<p t="1698180" d="2100">- [Safiya] The twist with
these nachos is that they have</p>
<p t="1700280" d="3240">barbecue sauce all over them.
- It&#39;s really sweet.</p>
<p t="1703520" d="1140">- It&#39;s all barbecue, baby.</p>
<p t="1704660" d="2490">Which is clearly one
of guy&#39;s staple moves.</p>
<p t="1707150" d="1230">As with all nachos,</p>
<p t="1708380" d="2990">they eventually cool down
into just a mound of stuff.</p>
<p t="1711370" d="2470">Is it sacrilege to eat this with a fork?</p>
<p t="1713840" d="1500">- [Tyler] It might be necessary.</p>
<p t="1715340" d="1470">- [Safiya] But it was
still pretty good to eat,</p>
<p t="1716810" d="2220">just as unidentifiable lumps.</p>
<p t="1719030" d="2670">Another thing we noticed was
that Guy is pretty generous</p>
<p t="1721700" d="1440">with his portion sizes.</p>
<p t="1723140" d="3183">Okay, a cheesecake just swung
by, it does look amazing.</p>
<p t="1727370" d="2130">- [Tyler] It&#39;s called
the Cheesecake Challenge.</p>
<p t="1729500" d="1980">- Like with this Bloody
Mary that we ordered</p>
<p t="1731480" d="2310">because Tyler&#39;s mom told us we had to.</p>
<p t="1733790" d="1230">Okay giant.</p>
<p t="1735020" d="2730">Which came with a huge
skewer of waffle fries</p>
<p t="1737750" d="2700">and an entire half of a jalapeno on top.</p>
<p t="1740450" d="2460">Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.</p>
<p t="1742910" d="2280">My Tatted-Up Turkey
burger was one of the more</p>
<p t="1745190" d="1980">terrifying dishes I&#39;ve ever eaten.</p>
<p t="1747170" d="1830">I don&#39;t know how to approach this.</p>
<p t="1749000" d="3480">The bun was tiny, but the
patty and fixings were huge.</p>
<p t="1752480" d="1020">Ha!</p>
<p t="1753500" d="2460">And the flavor almost knocked me over.</p>
<p t="1755960" d="1450">What am I tasting there?
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1757410" d="2420">There was ground Turkey, lettuce.</p>
<p t="1759830" d="1373">- [Tyler] That looks like
salsa on the left side there.</p>
<p t="1761203" d="2137">- [Safiya] I think some
salsa fell outta my burger.</p>
<p t="1763340" d="1890">And smokey gouda cheese.</p>
<p t="1765230" d="2580">Not bad, just powerful.</p>
<p t="1767810" d="2880">I asked for a trip to
Flavortown, he&#39;s taken me there.</p>
<p t="1770690" d="2700">And to end on a high but still large note,</p>
<p t="1773390" d="2790">the Big Dipper sandwich
was, according to Tyler,</p>
<p t="1776180" d="2730">one of the best things he
ate on our entire trip.</p>
<p t="1778910" d="1500">Napkin needed, napkin needed.</p>
<p t="1780410" d="1620">- That is amazing.</p>
<p t="1782030" d="1920">- [Safiya] It&#39;s kind of
like a half cheese steak,</p>
<p t="1783950" d="2820">half french dip love child
of a roast beef sandwich.</p>
<p t="1786770" d="2310">And Tyler wanted me to
specifically mention</p>
<p t="1789080" d="2430">that the hokey bread was very porous</p>
<p t="1791510" d="2790">and therefore very good
at soaking up the sauce.</p>
<p t="1794300" d="833">- I mean that&#39;s really important</p>
<p t="1795133" d="1747">when it comes to this kinda
sandwich is the bread.</p>
<p t="1796880" d="1560">- [Safiya] Now we had a blast here,</p>
<p t="1798440" d="2130">mostly because the vibes were just good.</p>
<p t="1800570" d="1170">- [Server] I like your guys&#39; shirts.</p>
<p t="1801740" d="990">- [Safiya] Thank you.</p>
<p t="1802730" d="2040">And though some of the food terrified me,</p>
<p t="1804770" d="2820">I would come back here with
four to five more people</p>
<p t="1807590" d="2100">so we could take on the
Cheesecake Challenge,</p>
<p t="1809690" d="2460">because it looks good,
we just need backup.</p>
<p t="1812150" d="2430">Next up on our list was
Giada De Laurentiis&#39;</p>
<p t="1814580" d="2730">eponymous Giada restaurant
at The Cromwell.</p>
<p t="1817310" d="1710">- We&#39;re gonna cook some spaghetti, yes.</p>
<p t="1819020" d="1650">- In wine?
- Yes.</p>
<p t="1820670" d="1620">- Hot dog.
- Yeah, right?</p>
<p t="1822290" d="2520">- [Safiya] Now Giada De
Laurentiis is another longtime</p>
<p t="1824810" d="1623">Food Network personality.</p>
<p t="1827540" d="1290">- Perfectly al dente.</p>
<p t="1828830" d="3007">- [Safiya] Who has hosted such
shows as &quot;Everyday Italian&quot;,</p>
<p t="1831837" d="3630">&quot;Giada at Home&quot;, &quot;Giada in
Italy&quot;, &quot;Giada Entertains&quot;,</p>
<p t="1835467" d="3143">&quot;Giada in Paradise&quot;, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p t="1838610" d="2610">- Because I&#39;ve got a lot of
Pinot Grigio in my fridge.</p>
<p t="1841220" d="1800">- [Safiya] If the show
names didn&#39;t tip you off,</p>
<p t="1843020" d="3600">Giada is from Italy and her
specialty is Italian cuisine.</p>
<p t="1846620" d="833">- Bravo.</p>
<p t="1847453" d="2167">- Now we&#39;ve actually been
to Giada&#39;s restaurant before</p>
<p t="1849620" d="1650">and we&#39;ve enjoyed ourselves a lot,</p>
<p t="1851270" d="1860">so we were plenty happy to go back.</p>
<p t="1853130" d="2490">The Cromwell itself is
a pretty small hotel</p>
<p t="1855620" d="2160">and they&#39;ve dedicated almost a third of it</p>
<p t="1857780" d="1230">to Giada&#39;s restaurant.</p>
<p t="1859010" d="2010">I like that Giada has her own wing.</p>
<p t="1861020" d="1440">- [Tyler] She has a big ass restaurant.</p>
<p t="1862460" d="1403">- Her own floor even.</p>
<p t="1863863" d="1657">Besides being huge,</p>
<p t="1865520" d="2130">it also features floor to ceiling windows</p>
<p t="1867650" d="2910">with pretty sweeping views of
the other side of the strip.</p>
<p t="1870560" d="3406">In this case, Caesars and The
Bellagio across the street.</p>
<p t="1873966" d="2297">I feel like pasta has
to be the call, right?</p>
<p t="1877220" d="833">Right?</p>
<p t="1878053" d="1657">One thing to note, on the menu,</p>
<p t="1879710" d="2430">she also includes a guide
as to how to pronounce</p>
<p t="1882140" d="1470">some of the specific dishes.</p>
<p t="1883610" d="833">Classic Giada.</p>
<p t="1884443" d="1357">- [Tyler] She&#39;s an emphasized pronouncer.</p>
<p t="1885800" d="2040">- [Safiya] This is kind of
a Food Network deep cut,</p>
<p t="1887840" d="1620">but one of the memes about Giada</p>
<p t="1889460" d="1560">is that she is pretty hardcore</p>
<p t="1891020" d="2340">with the pronunciation of Italian words.</p>
<p t="1893360" d="3785">- Spaghetti, linguine,
fettuccine, farfalle, orecchiette,</p>
<p t="1897145" d="833">(indistinct).</p>
<p t="1897978" d="2102">- [Safiya] And while I&#39;m sure
the names of Italian dishes</p>
<p t="1900080" d="1290">are often butchered.</p>
<p t="1901370" d="2449">- I like mascarpone.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1903819" d="1451">- A little bit of that, yeah.
- Mascarpone!</p>
<p t="1905270" d="1980">- [Safiya] The way she
wrote out the pronunciation</p>
<p t="1907250" d="3750">for spah-geh-tee on the menu
looks just like spaghetti,</p>
<p t="1911000" d="2310">so I&#39;m not sure how far
we&#39;re gonna get with that.</p>
<p t="1913310" d="1470">- [Tyler] How else do
people say spaghetti?</p>
<p t="1914780" d="1170">- Spag-hetti.</p>
<p t="1915950" d="1380">- No.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1917330" d="2940">- Now to prepare ourselves
for a deluge of pasta,</p>
<p t="1920270" d="3180">we got a couple of very
welcomed cappuccinos, yum.</p>
<p t="1923450" d="3600">And a few appetizers like
the saucy Orzo meatballs.</p>
<p t="1927050" d="1950">It&#39;s a meatball.</p>
<p t="1929000" d="1260">- [Tyler] It&#39;s a lemony meatball.</p>
<p t="1930260" d="2940">- [Safiya] And the salty yet
still fresh grilled artichoke.</p>
<p t="1933200" d="2100">- That&#39;s a good sour flavor
actually, I actually like that.</p>
<p t="1935300" d="2460">- [Safiya] Sour, maybe
that&#39;s the word I forgot.</p>
<p t="1937760" d="960">(laughs)</p>
<p t="1938720" d="1530">I forgot the word for sour.</p>
<p t="1940250" d="2040">But then we got into the good stuff.</p>
<p t="1942290" d="2040">We ordered the lemon
spaghetti with shrimp,</p>
<p t="1944330" d="2040">which is one of her signature pastas.</p>
<p t="1946370" d="1200">- [Tyler] It&#39;s a pretty beautiful plate.</p>
<p t="1947570" d="1740">- [Safiya] And it was
quite fresh in summery,</p>
<p t="1949310" d="1803">especially for a pasta dish.</p>
<p t="1952160" d="2550">- Signature-y?
- That&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="1954710" d="2760">And it also kind of started
off an oversized theme</p>
<p t="1957470" d="1950">that we began to notice in the restaurant,</p>
<p t="1959420" d="1680">because these shrimp were pretty big</p>
<p t="1961100" d="2910">as was the wheel of cheese
full of pasta that we got.</p>
<p t="1964010" d="1200">Do you see the cheese?</p>
<p t="1965210" d="3000">Look, this is cheese.
- Oh yeah.</p>
<p t="1968210" d="1980">- [Safiya] Which was then
seasoned by an enormous</p>
<p t="1970190" d="930">pepper grinder.</p>
<p t="1971120" d="2910">That was the biggest
pepper grinder shaker thing</p>
<p t="1974030" d="1170">I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p t="1975200" d="1110">- I think it&#39;s bigger than Giada.</p>
<p t="1976310" d="1411">- Literally.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="1977721" d="1019">It literally is.</p>
<p t="1978740" d="2010">All right, cheers.</p>
<p t="1980750" d="3120">The wheel of cheese itself
is hard to actually eat.</p>
<p t="1983870" d="1830">So it&#39;s not really like a bread bowl,</p>
<p t="1985700" d="1350">although I did just get a good hunk.</p>
<p t="1987050" d="2610">But the dish itself
basically ends up tasting</p>
<p t="1989660" d="2370">like a super fancy mac and cheese.</p>
<p t="1992030" d="3150">Creamy, a little bit salty
from the Pecorino Romano</p>
<p t="1995180" d="1980">and a nice kick from the cracked pepper.</p>
<p t="1997160" d="1680">The noodles closer to the wheel,</p>
<p t="1998840" d="1140">those are the money noodles.</p>
<p t="1999980" d="1364">- [Tyler] Cheese-mosis.</p>
<p t="2001344" d="1168">- Meow.</p>
<p t="2002512" d="1218">- [Tyler] Did you say meow or yeah?</p>
<p t="2003730" d="1530">- Both.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="2005260" d="833">Meow.</p>
<p t="2006093" d="3247">The only real miss of the meal
was the pistachio souffle.</p>
<p t="2009340" d="1560">- [Tyler] What even is this?</p>
<p t="2010900" d="1710">- What did I order?
- I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="2012610" d="2910">- It sounded good and was
very visually pleasing.</p>
<p t="2015520" d="2430">It&#39;s like vaguely green, but not really.</p>
<p t="2017950" d="2760">But the nuts on top were
overwhelmingly salty</p>
<p t="2020710" d="3360">and the raspberry sauce
was very tart, wow.</p>
<p t="2024070" d="1950">That&#39;s blasting me right
back to Flavortown.</p>
<p t="2026020" d="2190">But that shouldn&#39;t eclipse
the rest of Giada&#39;s meal</p>
<p t="2028210" d="1140">and her spaghetti.</p>
<p t="2029350" d="2580">This place is good and
we&#39;d happily go back.</p>
<p t="2031930" d="2250">- [Tyler] I&#39;m worried about
our pillow test upstairs.</p>
<p t="2034180" d="1740">- [Safiya] You might stay there forever?</p>
<p t="2035920" d="1230">- Never move.</p>
<p t="2037150" d="1380">- [Safiya] We gotta
get to Bally&#39;s tonight.</p>
<p t="2038530" d="2497">Now next up on our list
we have Lisa Vanderpump&#39;s</p>
<p t="2041027" d="3353">Vanderpump A Paris
restaurant at The Paris.</p>
<p t="2044380" d="2220">- Okay the party&#39;s started!</p>
<p t="2046600" d="2100">- [Safiya] And Lisa
Vanderpump is most well known</p>
<p t="2048700" d="2730">for being a real housewife
of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p t="2051430" d="1440">- [Lisa] You can stab me in the back,</p>
<p t="2052870" d="2610">but whilst you&#39;re there, kiss my ass.</p>
<p t="2055480" d="2460">- [Safiya] As well as for
starring in &quot;Vanderpump Rules&quot;</p>
<p t="2057940" d="833">on Bravo.</p>
<p t="2058773" d="2737">A show which follows her and
the staff at her restaurants</p>
<p t="2061510" d="1701">and bars in West Hollywood.</p>
<p t="2063211" d="2460">- Joe, I need my daily fix.</p>
<p t="2065671" d="1389">What&#39;s the special tonight?</p>
<p t="2067060" d="1980">- [Safiya] Now this is a bit
of a controversial addition</p>
<p t="2069040" d="3450">to our list, mostly because
Lisa herself is not a chef.</p>
<p t="2072490" d="2310">So in some ways she
shouldn&#39;t be on the list.</p>
<p t="2074800" d="2040">But we had a hard time taking her off</p>
<p t="2076840" d="1680">because unlike the Jonas Brothers,</p>
<p t="2078520" d="1920">she was a well-established restaurateur</p>
<p t="2080440" d="1770">before rising to TV fame.</p>
<p t="2082210" d="2190">- It&#39;s all going according to plan.</p>
<p t="2084400" d="1770">- [Safiya] And the show &quot;Vanderpump Rules&quot;</p>
<p t="2086170" d="2580">does specifically show her
running her restaurants,</p>
<p t="2088750" d="3271">even if it is more about the
love lives of her employees.</p>
<p t="2092021" d="1916">- I&#39;ve just seen your boyfriend.</p>
<p t="2093937" d="2553">I do not wanna be dealing
with him, okay go.</p>
<p t="2096490" d="1350">- [Safiya] We are also big fans.</p>
<p t="2097840" d="2790">Lisa Vanderpump is actually
Tyler&#39;s celebrity crush,</p>
<p t="2100630" d="1410">so we really wanted to go.</p>
<p t="2102040" d="1890">There she is, that saucy minx.</p>
<p t="2103930" d="1350">On the strip specifically,</p>
<p t="2105280" d="3030">Lisa does also have a cocktail
lounge at Caesar&#39;s Palace,</p>
<p t="2108310" d="1290">which we did stop by.</p>
<p t="2109600" d="3090">But Vanderpump A Paris is
her only real restaurant.</p>
<p t="2112690" d="2310">And visually it&#39;s a show stopper.</p>
<p t="2115000" d="2130">It&#39;s arguably over decorated.</p>
<p t="2117130" d="1470">- [Tyler] Could use more Pomeranians.</p>
<p t="2118600" d="2280">- But it&#39;s also kind of awesomely ornate</p>
<p t="2120880" d="3180">with rod iron room dividers,
faux thunderstorms,</p>
<p t="2124060" d="3660">crazy street lamps, roses
everywhere, it&#39;s a lot.</p>
<p t="2127720" d="2730">The menu is like a big newspaper,</p>
<p t="2130450" d="3060">it&#39;s very cute, but
it&#39;s kinda hard to read.</p>
<p t="2133510" d="2670">And the cuisine here is
built as delectable dishes</p>
<p t="2136180" d="1890">with a little bit of of a French twist.</p>
<p t="2138070" d="3000">They may call me a sinner,
but I&#39;m at peace with myself.</p>
<p t="2141070" d="2940">- [Tyler] It&#39;s sort of like
intro lines to real housewives.</p>
<p t="2144010" d="2550">- [Safiya] Which we
understood as mostly cocktails</p>
<p t="2146560" d="1410">and some fun small plates.</p>
<p t="2147970" d="1560">There are a couple of entrees,</p>
<p t="2149530" d="2250">but the entree section of the menu is tiny</p>
<p t="2151780" d="1410">and impossible to find.</p>
<p t="2153190" d="1824">So we followed that through line.</p>
<p t="2155014" d="1356">- [Tyler] Woo.</p>
<p t="2156370" d="1740">- [Safiya] And ordered a fancy cocktail</p>
<p t="2158110" d="3120">which was delivered in a glass
pyramid and a puff of smoke.</p>
<p t="2161230" d="1723">- [Tyler] Yeah, all that
smoke went right into my face.</p>
<p t="2162953" d="857">(laughs)</p>
<p t="2163810" d="2100">- It smelled very campfire-y.
- It was amazing.</p>
<p t="2165910" d="1620">- [Safiya] And was quite strong.</p>
<p t="2167530" d="930">- I&#39;m drunk already.</p>
<p t="2168460" d="1590">- All right, no more, no more, that&#39;s it.</p>
<p t="2170050" d="2730">And then all of the food we
got was like small plates,</p>
<p t="2172780" d="1410">finger food kind of stuff.</p>
<p t="2174190" d="1080">The Ratatouille Frites</p>
<p t="2175270" d="1740">were the only thing I wouldn&#39;t recommend.</p>
<p t="2177010" d="1800">They didn&#39;t have a lot
of substance to them,</p>
<p t="2178810" d="2370">so they were kind of just
like little wisps of air.</p>
<p t="2181180" d="2250">It almost tastes like
calamari but no squid.</p>
<p t="2183430" d="1020">- [Tyler] It looks like calamari.</p>
<p t="2184450" d="1860">- Calamari but just the batter.</p>
<p t="2186310" d="3613">The Menage a Tomates salad was
sort of tomatoes three ways.</p>
<p t="2189923" d="833">- [Tyler] Let &#39;er rip.</p>
<p t="2192020" d="1340">You getting a menage to the mouth?</p>
<p t="2193360" d="2100">- Yes, but the goat cheese is very greedy.</p>
<p t="2196420" d="2213">- Greedy?
- In bed?</p>
<p t="2198633" d="833">(laughs)</p>
<p t="2199466" d="2234">- And it may not have been
the most groundbreaking dish.</p>
<p t="2201700" d="1560">Yeah, cut that in half
so then I can piggyback</p>
<p t="2203260" d="960">off of your menage.</p>
<p t="2204220" d="2850">But after having been on the
strip for nearly two weeks,</p>
<p t="2207070" d="2370">subsisting mostly on Starbucks egg bites</p>
<p t="2209440" d="1980">and celebrity chef restaurant fair,</p>
<p t="2211420" d="3810">there hasn&#39;t been a lot of
fresh air nor fresh vegetables</p>
<p t="2215230" d="840">on this trip.</p>
<p t="2216070" d="2910">Just some nice juicy tomatoes
with cracked pepper on &#39;em,</p>
<p t="2218980" d="1170">really hit the spot.</p>
<p t="2220150" d="2490">The truffle baguette was also very good.</p>
<p t="2222640" d="900">It&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="2223540" d="2220">I know we have previously
complained about truffle</p>
<p t="2225760" d="1800">being an overwhelming flavor,</p>
<p t="2227560" d="2790">but there was just enough
bread, brie and honey in this</p>
<p t="2230350" d="1560">that we were able to taste something</p>
<p t="2231910" d="1350">other than just truffle.</p>
<p t="2233260" d="900">You know what else is in there?</p>
<p t="2234160" d="1740">- What?
- Thyme.</p>
<p t="2235900" d="1860">Only gets better with thyme,
just like Lisa Vanderpump.</p>
<p t="2237760" d="833">- Awesome.</p>
<p t="2240010" d="833">- Tryna help you out there.</p>
<p t="2240843" d="2857">And then for dessert,
we got the rose eclairs</p>
<p t="2243700" d="2400">and there&#39;s gold leaf flakes on there.</p>
<p t="2246100" d="2130">The rose flavor was a bit overpowered</p>
<p t="2248230" d="3060">by a competing raspberry
flavor somewhere in there.</p>
<p t="2251290" d="2340">Goodbye, Kyle!
(laughs)</p>
<p t="2253630" d="2040">So it was more of a raspberry eclair,</p>
<p t="2255670" d="2940">but the creme en glaze inside
was really fluffy and light</p>
<p t="2258610" d="3660">and not too sweet and I love
me a not too sweet dessert.</p>
<p t="2262270" d="1380">- [Ken] Goodbye, Kyle.</p>
<p t="2263650" d="2620">- [Safiya] So overall, we
found Vanderpump A Paris</p>
<p t="2266270" d="2690">to be a whimsical and fun experience,</p>
<p t="2268960" d="2700">pretty much just as over
the top as Lisa herself</p>
<p t="2271660" d="1860">and as booze filled as an episode</p>
<p t="2273520" d="2280">of the &quot;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot;.</p>
<p t="2275800" d="2220">So pretty much exactly what I&#39;d hoped for.</p>
<p t="2278020" d="2160">Now, our penultimate couple of restaurants</p>
<p t="2280180" d="1650">were at the MGM Grand,</p>
<p t="2281830" d="2940">which has a specific wing of
the hotel called The District,</p>
<p t="2284770" d="2430">which actually has a bunch of
celebrity owned restaurants</p>
<p t="2287200" d="2520">in a row, including the
Jonas Brothers&#39; restaurant,</p>
<p t="2289720" d="1980">which I&#39;m starting to
feel sad that we missed.</p>
<p t="2291700" d="3060">First on our list was
Masaharu Morimoto&#39;s eponymous</p>
<p t="2294760" d="1357">Japanese restaurant.</p>
<p t="2296117" d="1133">- [Tyler] &quot;Iron Chef&quot;.</p>
<p t="2297250" d="1380">- [Safiya] Masaharu Morimoto,</p>
<p t="2298630" d="1530">apologies if I&#39;m saying it wrong,</p>
<p t="2300160" d="2470">was famously one of the
Iron Chefs on the original</p>
<p t="2302630" d="2780">Japanese version of the
show in the nineties.</p>
<p t="2305410" d="3000">- [Announcer] Iron Chef
Japanese is Masaharu Morimoto.</p>
<p t="2308410" d="1410">- [Safiya] And then when the Food Network</p>
<p t="2309820" d="2820">decided to produce their
own version in the 2000s,</p>
<p t="2312640" d="2280">he signed on as one of the Iron Chefs,</p>
<p t="2314920" d="1830">lending the American version of the show</p>
<p t="2316750" d="1710">some serious legitimacy.</p>
<p t="2318460" d="1590">- [Host] A year ago they said this program</p>
<p t="2320050" d="2880">couldn&#39;t make it on American
TV, well look at us now.</p>
<p t="2322930" d="1560">- [Safiya] He actually
has a bunch of restaurants</p>
<p t="2324490" d="833">around the world,</p>
<p t="2325323" d="2804">but I&#39;m pretty sure that this
is his only one in Vegas.</p>
<p t="2328127" d="2833">(speaks Japanese)</p>
<p t="2333684" d="833">(laughs)</p>
<p t="2334517" d="2873">- And the vibe in here is
very modern, dark and sleek.</p>
<p t="2337390" d="2280">There&#39;s an open sushi
bar kitchen in the first,</p>
<p t="2339670" d="2160">more narrow room and then in the back room</p>
<p t="2341830" d="2820">there is a special Teppanyaki
grill station as well.</p>
<p t="2344650" d="2331">It&#39;s a great menu, it&#39;s like
everything that we like,</p>
<p t="2346981" d="879">basically.
- Yes.</p>
<p t="2347860" d="2190">- So to hit some of
Morimoto&#39;s specialties,</p>
<p t="2350050" d="1890">we ordered a lot of raw fish</p>
<p t="2351940" d="2413">and some sizzling hot stone dishes.</p>
<p t="2354353" d="2267">Okay we just ordered a
bunch of different stuff</p>
<p t="2356620" d="1410">and then Tyler goes,</p>
<p t="2358030" d="1982">feel free to keep the Diet Cokes coming.</p>
<p t="2360012" d="1558">- [Tyler] I dunno if they
charge for the refills.</p>
<p t="2361570" d="2520">- A lot of the sushi is
actually sold by the piece.</p>
<p t="2364090" d="2340">So I kind of just ordered
a bunch of pieces.</p>
<p t="2366430" d="1587">Wow, that&#39;s beautiful.</p>
<p t="2368017" d="2013">And our server really liked yellowtails,</p>
<p t="2370030" d="2247">so we ended up with a lot of yellowtail.</p>
<p t="2372277" d="1920">That went down easy, I love that.</p>
<p t="2374197" d="2493">And the sushi was overall very good.</p>
<p t="2376690" d="2070">There are a lot of sound
bites from our footage here</p>
<p t="2378760" d="1494">of us just liking it.</p>
<p t="2380254" d="2003">Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg.</p>
<p t="2383410" d="1975">Why is that cute to me?
- It is adorable.</p>
<p t="2385385" d="1835">It looks like the rice is
carrying a giant egg mattress.</p>
<p t="2387220" d="2070">- [Safiya] We are by no
means sushi connoisseurs,</p>
<p t="2389290" d="1890">but I thought the rice was quite vinegar-y</p>
<p t="2391180" d="1980">and the fish was very soft and melty.</p>
<p t="2393160" d="2449">- It might be the best
cut roll I&#39;ve ever had.</p>
<p t="2395609" d="833">I love that.</p>
<p t="2396442" d="2125">- [Safiya] Are you shilling
for Morimoto right now?</p>
<p t="2398567" d="1163">- &quot;Iron Chef&quot; me up.</p>
<p t="2399730" d="2310">- [Safiya] We did also get
the raw yellowtail tacos.</p>
<p t="2402040" d="2373">- That&#39;s delicious and
it didn&#39;t fall apart.</p>
<p t="2404413" d="1977">- [Safiya] They had yuzu in them.</p>
<p t="2406390" d="2370">- There&#39;s some yuzu in there.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="2408760" d="833">That&#39;s what it is.</p>
<p t="2409593" d="2257">- As well as lime and avocado
and they were very fresh</p>
<p t="2411850" d="1470">and citrusy and crunchy.</p>
<p t="2413320" d="3570">It&#39;s mostly guacamole and
spicy peppers, which is good,</p>
<p t="2416890" d="1476">inside of a wonton shell.</p>
<p t="2418366" d="833">It&#39;s good.</p>
<p t="2419199" d="1741">And then we got a couple
of hot stone dishes</p>
<p t="2420940" d="2160">including these sizzling pork gyoza.</p>
<p t="2423100" d="1293">I&#39;m nervous, I don&#39;t
want to burn my mouth.</p>
<p t="2424393" d="987">- [Tyler] I&#39;ll go first.</p>
<p t="2425380" d="1500">- [Safiya] Which once they cooled down.</p>
<p t="2426880" d="2310">- A little hot.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="2429190" d="1800">- [Safiya] Were nice and
crispy on the outside</p>
<p t="2430990" d="2010">and well scallioned on the inside.</p>
<p t="2433000" d="2220">And then we also got the char siu bop,</p>
<p t="2435220" d="2400">which is pork belly, rice
and some other veggies,</p>
<p t="2437620" d="1650">cooked in a hot stone bowl.</p>
<p t="2439270" d="2940">It did sort of just taste like
a twist on a fried rice dish.</p>
<p t="2442210" d="3090">But I do love when rice gets
crispy at the bottom like this.</p>
<p t="2445300" d="1020">Thank you.</p>
<p t="2446320" d="2100">Then an item without a category,</p>
<p t="2448420" d="2610">we did get the Jasmine
panna cotta for dessert.</p>
<p t="2451030" d="1830">What&#39;s that?
- I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="2452860" d="1650">- What&#39;s this?
- I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="2454510" d="2340">- Which came paired with
some blueberry ice cream</p>
<p t="2456850" d="2400">and lemon sorbet and kind of had the vibe</p>
<p t="2459250" d="2940">of a key lime pie filling
except instead of lime,</p>
<p t="2462190" d="1920">it was jasmine tea flavored.</p>
<p t="2464110" d="3210">It&#39;s like four desserts
in one, I&#39;m obsessed.</p>
<p t="2467320" d="2430">Now we ran up quite the tab at Morimoto&#39;s,</p>
<p t="2469750" d="1650">but there were very few misses</p>
<p t="2471400" d="2130">and I would come back for
pretty much everything,</p>
<p t="2473530" d="2850">including the many Diet
Cokes they sent our way.</p>
<p t="2476380" d="990">- [Tyler] They kept &#39;em coming.</p>
<p t="2477370" d="2730">- [Safiya] Now next upon our
list was Emeril Lagasse&#39;s,</p>
<p t="2480100" d="2820">New Orleans Fish House,
just down the hall.</p>
<p t="2482920" d="1530">- Bingo!
- Right?</p>
<p t="2484450" d="1890">- [Safiya] Though, thankfully
we went on a separate day,</p>
<p t="2486340" d="2070">not just right after Morimoto&#39;s.</p>
<p t="2488410" d="2917">Emeril is a true OG Food Network star.</p>
<p t="2491327" d="1793">- Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, hey!</p>
<p t="2493120" d="2007">And you take some peanut and you go bam!</p>
<p t="2495127" d="2133">Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!</p>
<p t="2497260" d="2040">- Having hosted many shows on the network,</p>
<p t="2499300" d="1890">all the way back to the early nineties.</p>
<p t="2501190" d="2100">In fact, Tyler&#39;s even
said that some of his</p>
<p t="2503290" d="2880">earliest memories are of
his mom watching Emeril.</p>
<p t="2506170" d="2163">- [Audience] Bam, bam, bam, bam!</p>
<p t="2508333" d="1777">- Bam, there you have
it, right now, all right?</p>
<p t="2510110" d="1520">- [Safiya] Which is pretty cute.</p>
<p t="2511630" d="2070">- [Tyler] That was like
the background television</p>
<p t="2513700" d="1800">of my very, very toddler youth.</p>
<p t="2515500" d="2610">- [Safiya] And Emeril
specializes in Creole, Cajun</p>
<p t="2518110" d="2760">and his self-developed
new New Orleans cuisine</p>
<p t="2520870" d="2700">and also has previously
contributed recipes</p>
<p t="2523570" d="2340">to be used on the
International Space Station,</p>
<p t="2525910" d="833">which is pretty cool.</p>
<p t="2526743" d="2257">- Come on, this isn&#39;t
rocket scientists now here.</p>
<p t="2529000" d="1050">- Beyond the Fish House,</p>
<p t="2530050" d="3120">Emeril also has a Delmonico&#39;s
Steakhouse at The Venetian,</p>
<p t="2533170" d="1560">but we wanted to go for a restaurant</p>
<p t="2534730" d="2370">that really showcased
his signature cuisine.</p>
<p t="2537100" d="2970">The atmosphere at the Fish
House is actually very inviting.</p>
<p t="2540070" d="1470">Built around a circular bar</p>
<p t="2541540" d="2490">in the middle of the dining
room, it&#39;s pretty open</p>
<p t="2544030" d="2730">with warm toned woods and a large two-part</p>
<p t="2546760" d="1620">bronzy fish statue.</p>
<p t="2548380" d="2610">And we ended up ordering
just a few things.</p>
<p t="2550990" d="1770">First off, the clam chowder.</p>
<p t="2552760" d="1948">All right, chowder head,</p>
<p t="2554708" d="1202">go for it.
- Chowder head.</p>
<p t="2555910" d="833">Me.</p>
<p t="2556743" d="1657">- [Safiya] And Tyler said Emeril&#39;s chowder</p>
<p t="2558400" d="2070">was nice and creamy and peppery</p>
<p t="2560470" d="2310">and the clams were the
right amount of chewy.</p>
<p t="2562780" d="1560">- That&#39;s so delicious, holy crap.</p>
<p t="2564340" d="2250">- [Safiya] Is Emeril the
king of chowder heads?</p>
<p t="2566590" d="2700">- No, I don&#39;t, that might
be very controversial</p>
<p t="2569290" d="2250">to say to New Englanders.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="2571540" d="2430">- We also got the barbecue shrimp,</p>
<p t="2573970" d="930">that&#39;s super good.</p>
<p t="2574900" d="1440">And this sauce that comes with it</p>
<p t="2576340" d="2160">was very difficult for me to dissect.</p>
<p t="2578500" d="1860">What witchcraft is this?</p>
<p t="2580360" d="3480">It was a little spicy, a
little herby, a little tangy,</p>
<p t="2583840" d="1560">a tad sweet, maybe.</p>
<p t="2585400" d="1620">I have to figure out what&#39;s in the sauce</p>
<p t="2587020" d="2700">because I can&#39;t place it
at all, but it&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="2589720" d="2760">It turns out that this
is Emeril&#39;s secret sauce,</p>
<p t="2592480" d="1530">his essence, if you will.</p>
<p t="2594010" d="3450">- Now a lot of people have
asked me, what&#39;s the essence?</p>
<p t="2597460" d="1440">- [Safiya] Is it balsamic?</p>
<p t="2598900" d="833">Help me out here.</p>
<p t="2599733" d="1807">And I think the things I was tasting</p>
<p t="2601540" d="3630">were the cayenne pepper, garlic
powder, oregano, and thyme.</p>
<p t="2605170" d="1080">- That&#39;s the essence.</p>
<p t="2606250" d="2730">- I would recommend this dish
just based on the sauce alone.</p>
<p t="2608980" d="2130">The jambalaya was also very seasoned,</p>
<p t="2611110" d="3390">possibly with another iteration
of Emeril&#39;s secret essence</p>
<p t="2614500" d="1860">as it had a pretty good kick to it.</p>
<p t="2616360" d="2100">That spiced rice is nice.</p>
<p t="2618460" d="1860">To be honest, at this point in our trip,</p>
<p t="2620320" d="1590">we were definitely experiencing</p>
<p t="2621910" d="2130">a little bit of celebrity chef burnout</p>
<p t="2624040" d="2250">or maybe just general casino burnout,</p>
<p t="2626290" d="2760">so we perhaps were not on
top of our tasting game.</p>
<p t="2629050" d="1916">- Well it&#39;s that kind of day, Rach!</p>
<p t="2630966" d="1294">What can you say?</p>
<p t="2632260" d="1380">- [Safiya] But we liked what we ordered</p>
<p t="2633640" d="2730">and if you are a seafood
lover or Tyler&#39;s mom,</p>
<p t="2636370" d="1920">you would probably also like it here.</p>
<p t="2638290" d="3090">That said, I really wish we had
gotten the banana cream pie.</p>
<p t="2641380" d="1890">Apparently it&#39;s really, really good.</p>
<p t="2643270" d="2820">- Kick it up a notch with
a little caramel like that.</p>
<p t="2646090" d="1800">Add a little chocolate like that</p>
<p t="2647890" d="2280">and finish it just like that.
(audience cheers)</p>
<p t="2650170" d="2400">- So I might need to come
back for that specifically.</p>
<p t="2652570" d="3180">And then for our last official
celebrity chef restaurant</p>
<p t="2655750" d="2520">on the strip, we have
Robert Irvine&#39;s Public House</p>
<p t="2658270" d="1263">at the Tropicana.</p>
<p t="2660790" d="2010">Welcome to the final hotel.</p>
<p t="2662800" d="1440">Though we do have a couple of other</p>
<p t="2664240" d="1830">celebrity chef restaurants we visited</p>
<p t="2666070" d="1590">that I figured I&#39;d throw in at the end,</p>
<p t="2667660" d="1590">so stay tuned for those as well.</p>
<p t="2669250" d="3600">Now Robert Irvine is a buff ex-Royal Navy</p>
<p t="2672850" d="2100">British celebrity chef who has hosted</p>
<p t="2674950" d="1431">many a Food Network show.</p>
<p t="2676381" d="2049">(hammer bangs)</p>
<p t="2678430" d="1380">- Let&#39;s get to work.</p>
<p t="2679810" d="1440">- [Safiya] He has a few claims to fame,</p>
<p t="2681250" d="2940">like serving on Queen Elizabeth&#39;s
royal yacht, Britannia,</p>
<p t="2684190" d="2910">preparing food at the White
House and allegedly helping make</p>
<p t="2687100" d="2220">Charles and Diana&#39;s royal wedding cake,</p>
<p t="2689320" d="1560">some of which have been disputed.</p>
<p t="2690880" d="2760">- [Robert] Smokey, sizzly ribby ribbies.</p>
<p t="2693640" d="1890">- [Safiya] But those
are his claims to fame.</p>
<p t="2695530" d="3990">And Tyler and I are interested
by how truly buff he is.</p>
<p t="2699520" d="3090">Oh my God, not his throbbing forearm.</p>
<p t="2702610" d="960">And I think that&#39;s fair</p>
<p t="2703570" d="2210">because it&#39;s a major part of his brand.</p>
<p t="2705780" d="1540">(screams)</p>
<p t="2707320" d="3090">He currently owns slash
operates two restaurants,</p>
<p t="2710410" d="2280">Robert Irvine&#39;s Public
House at the Tropicana,</p>
<p t="2712690" d="2100">and Fresh Kitchen by Robert Irvine,</p>
<p t="2714790" d="3150">located inside of the
Pentagon in Washington DC.</p>
<p t="2717940" d="1340">- Now we&#39;re cooking!</p>
<p t="2719280" d="3460">- So I guess his vibe is
like buff military chef.</p>
<p t="2722740" d="3120">Vein&#39;s popping, he flexes
and the booties pop.</p>
<p t="2725860" d="2163">- Robert Irvine.
- Volcano!</p>
<p t="2729220" d="2460">- Now the Public House
is a warm and inviting,</p>
<p t="2731680" d="2400">casual dining spot next
to the casino floor</p>
<p t="2734080" d="1080">of the Tropicana.</p>
<p t="2735160" d="2250">And the cuisine is supposed to be pub grub</p>
<p t="2737410" d="3210">geared towards the pats, AKA Americans.</p>
<p t="2740620" d="2370">I want a pizza, can I have a pizza?</p>
<p t="2742990" d="1140">- [Tyler] Pizzeria pizza.</p>
<p t="2744130" d="1980">- It&#39;s late night, it&#39;s time for a pizza.</p>
<p t="2746110" d="3120">So we got a couple of
casual pat focused dishes</p>
<p t="2749230" d="2670">as well as a couple of
Robert&#39;s personal favorites,</p>
<p t="2751900" d="870">starting with his</p>
<p t="2752770" d="1320">eponymous drink order,
(bell chimes)</p>
<p t="2754090" d="2760">which is a shot of tequila
and a Stella Artois.</p>
<p t="2756850" d="1200">Wow.</p>
<p t="2758050" d="1170">That&#39;s a tall shot.</p>
<p t="2759220" d="2520">And our server confirmed
that he has literally seen</p>
<p t="2761740" d="1410">Robert Irvine drink this.</p>
<p t="2763150" d="1830">Last night in Vegas.</p>
<p t="2764980" d="833">- That&#39;s tequila.</p>
<p t="2765813" d="1117">- [Safiya] This will
make you just as ripped</p>
<p t="2766930" d="1110">as Robert Irvine.</p>
<p t="2768040" d="1860">We also got the pastrami sandwich,</p>
<p t="2769900" d="3270">which Robert is pictured all
over the Tropicana holding up</p>
<p t="2773170" d="1380">next to a large knife.</p>
<p t="2774550" d="2160">- [Tyler] All over the casino.</p>
<p t="2776710" d="2070">- And this sandwich was
a little intimidating.</p>
<p t="2778780" d="2760">The pastrami meat was
salty and a little spicy.</p>
<p t="2781540" d="1140">The Swiss was sharp,</p>
<p t="2782680" d="2850">the rye and the sauerkraut
were sour and a little bitter.</p>
<p t="2785530" d="1965">It kinda puts some chest hair on you,</p>
<p t="2787495" d="833">you know what I mean?
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="2788328" d="1972">- No wonder this is
Robert&#39;s sandwich of choice.</p>
<p t="2790300" d="1230">What&#39;s happening to you?</p>
<p t="2791530" d="2430">Suddenly your hair, it&#39;s graying,</p>
<p t="2793960" d="3510">your biceps, they&#39;re growing,
your accent, it&#39;s changing.</p>
<p t="2797470" d="2670">- Hey there matey.
(laughs)</p>
<p t="2800140" d="2250">- We also ordered the waygu beef sliders,</p>
<p t="2802390" d="1800">which had these crispy onions on the side</p>
<p t="2804190" d="1440">that were kind of addictive.</p>
<p t="2805630" d="1830">If you hear any crunching
behind the camera,</p>
<p t="2807460" d="2100">I&#39;m really sorry, I&#39;ve
been eating crunchy onions</p>
<p t="2809560" d="833">the whole time.</p>
<p t="2810393" d="3067">We also got the Rosso red
pizza, which was fine overall.</p>
<p t="2813460" d="2940">If I were drunk off of
a double shot tequila</p>
<p t="2816400" d="2010">and a single Stella Artois.
- You mean like me?</p>
<p t="2818410" d="2010">- [Safiya] This pizza would hit the spot.</p>
<p t="2820420" d="2790">Nothing to write home about,
but certainly not bad.</p>
<p t="2823210" d="3781">- It&#39;s pretty good but I have
had a double shot tequila.</p>
<p t="2826991" d="1109">(laughs)</p>
<p t="2828100" d="2490">- Now Robert&#39;s spot is
certainly more casual</p>
<p t="2830590" d="2040">than some of the other
restaurants on the list,</p>
<p t="2832630" d="3360">but I will say the price point
was, for the Vegas strip,</p>
<p t="2835990" d="1020">pretty reasonable.</p>
<p t="2837010" d="2610">In fact, as I noted in our hotel&#39;s video,</p>
<p t="2839620" d="3600">our entire order here, including
the Robert Irvine drink,</p>
<p t="2843220" d="3090">was cheaper than three chicken
sandwiches at Johnny Rockets.</p>
<p t="2846310" d="2730">So I am actually pro
Robert Irvine right now.</p>
<p t="2849040" d="2670">In fact, if you ever find
yourself at the Luxor</p>
<p t="2851710" d="3210">and considering eating at the
Johnny Rockets there, don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="2854920" d="2525">Cross the street and
go to Robert Irvine&#39;s.</p>
<p t="2857445" d="1522">Just do it.</p>
<p t="2858967" d="833">Just do it.</p>
<p t="2859800" d="2530">He may be vaguely threatening
with his pastrami sandwich,</p>
<p t="2862330" d="1710">but he&#39;s a pretty reasonable man.</p>
<p t="2864040" d="2550">Don&#39;t you dare give another
dollar to Johnny Rockets.</p>
<p t="2866590" d="2730">Okay, so there were a couple
more celeb chef restaurants</p>
<p t="2869320" d="2040">that we visited sort of incidentally,</p>
<p t="2871360" d="1680">just because we thought they seemed cool.</p>
<p t="2873040" d="1920">We didn&#39;t document them
quite as thoroughly,</p>
<p t="2874960" d="1837">but I did wanna throw them in.</p>
<p t="2876797" d="1973">We&#39;re at Strip Steak,
we&#39;re on the Vegas strip.</p>
<p t="2878770" d="2910">Tyler is doing a strip
tease, he&#39;s eating a steak.</p>
<p t="2881680" d="1467">- Incredible.</p>
<p t="2883147" d="1653">- [Safiya] We went to Michael
Mina&#39;s Strip Steak restaurant</p>
<p t="2884800" d="1560">at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.</p>
<p t="2886360" d="3210">- San Francisco&#39;s
Superman of Surf and Turf,</p>
<p t="2889570" d="3780">the legendary Michael Mina.
(chefs cheer)</p>
<p t="2893350" d="2220">- [Safiya] Michael Mina didn&#39;t
quite meet our requirements</p>
<p t="2895570" d="2010">because he&#39;s never starred in his own show</p>
<p t="2897580" d="2580">or other long form content that I know of,</p>
<p t="2900160" d="2670">but he&#39;s a very accomplished
chef and restaurateur.</p>
<p t="2902830" d="1110">- Let&#39;s do this.
- Let&#39;s do this.</p>
<p t="2903940" d="1920">- [Safiya] Known for
modern American cuisine,</p>
<p t="2905860" d="2190">seafood and Mediterranean fair.</p>
<p t="2908050" d="2070">We got a smattering of different dishes.</p>
<p t="2910120" d="840">- [Tyler] They didn&#39;t give you chopsticks,</p>
<p t="2910960" d="1587">so you might have to just fork it.</p>
<p t="2912547" d="1113">- Spear it?
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="2913660" d="1230">- With my steak knife.</p>
<p t="2914890" d="3030">Including the Ahi tuna
rolls, the filet mignon</p>
<p t="2917920" d="2160">and the spicy Thai lettuce cups.</p>
<p t="2920080" d="1743">That&#39;s very good, oh it&#39;s spicy.</p>
<p t="2923123" d="3917">As well as a magnificent bowl
of jalapeno creamed corn,</p>
<p t="2927040" d="2673">which kind of tasted
like molten cornbread.</p>
<p t="2929713" d="833">Touche, Michael Mina, touche.</p>
<p t="2931660" d="2640">We also went to Roy Choi&#39;s
Best Friend restaurant</p>
<p t="2934300" d="2790">at the Park MGM, which
has a really cool vibe.</p>
<p t="2937090" d="1770">It&#39;s heavily themed and decorated</p>
<p t="2938860" d="2190">as a Korean convenience
store in the front.</p>
<p t="2941050" d="960">And then in the back,</p>
<p t="2942010" d="2190">the main dining area is a large room</p>
<p t="2944200" d="2220">that&#39;s kind of themed like a block party.</p>
<p t="2946420" d="2880">Roy Choi&#39;s main claim to fame
is that he was the creator</p>
<p t="2949300" d="4020">of the popular Mexican Korean
fusion taco truck Kogi.</p>
<p t="2953320" d="1230">- If you don&#39;t look like Dexter</p>

kimchi, you didn&#39;t do right.</p>
<p t="2957190" d="2040">- [Safiya] And he&#39;s considered
to be one of the founders</p>
<p t="2959230" d="1950">of the gourmet food truck movement.</p>
<p t="2961180" d="1650">We honestly just went to this restaurant</p>
<p t="2962830" d="1140">because it seemed good.</p>
<p t="2963970" d="1290">We didn&#39;t think that Roy Choi</p>
<p t="2965260" d="1710">technically fit our requirements,</p>
<p t="2966970" d="2070">but it turns out that he does appear</p>
<p t="2969040" d="1890">in &quot;The Chef Show&quot; with John Favreau.</p>
<p t="2970930" d="837">- Look at that.</p>

<p t="2986824" d="833">- [Safiya] But as it is,</p>
<p t="2987657" d="2293">we ended up getting some
of the veggie side dishes,</p>

<p t="3002220" d="3120">They also gave us some
complimentary Hawaiian sweet rolls,</p>
<p t="3005340" d="1260">which were awesome.</p>
<p t="3006600" d="2090">- They&#39;re definitely enhancing this, okay?</p>
<p t="3008690" d="1540">- Is this Hawaiian bread enhanced?</p>
<p t="3010230" d="3570">And their drinks all came served
in huge ceramic solo cups,</p>
<p t="3013800" d="833">which was cool.</p>
<p t="3014633" d="1685">- That&#39;s a girthy cup.</p>
<p t="3016318" d="1832">- It&#39;s as big as Tyler&#39;s head.
- It is.</p>
<p t="3018150" d="1890">- [Safiya] Now onto the people we missed.</p>
<p t="3020040" d="1950">Yes, we may have made a couple of mistakes</p>
<p t="3021990" d="2670">in trimming down our list
of people, I apologize,</p>
<p t="3024660" d="1590">but I wanted to include them here</p>
<p t="3026250" d="1710">just at least as an acknowledgement.</p>
<p t="3027960" d="2040">Since we went to Vegas this past summer,</p>
<p t="3030000" d="2910">Martha Stewart actually opened
up her first ever restaurant</p>
<p t="3032910" d="1920">at the Paris called the Bedford,</p>
<p t="3034830" d="1680">which Snoop Dogg seems to love,</p>
<p t="3036510" d="1050">but we didn&#39;t get to go</p>
<p t="3037560" d="2340">because it was still under
construction at the time.</p>
<p t="3039900" d="1710">We also missed Wolfgang Puck,</p>
<p t="3041610" d="2400">I think because he&#39;s so
famous and ubiquitous,</p>
<p t="3044010" d="3360">I almost forgot he was a real
person who still does content.</p>
<p t="3047370" d="1890">I almost think of him like Campbell Soup,</p>
<p t="3049260" d="2430">but he does have five
restaurants on the strip</p>
<p t="3051690" d="2610">and a Wolfgang Puck Express
in the Vegas airport.</p>
<p t="3054300" d="2010">Michael Mina does have another restaurant</p>
<p t="3056310" d="3000">that is a joint venture slash
collab with Ayesha Curry</p>
<p t="3059310" d="2790">called International
Smoke at the MGM Grand.</p>
<p t="3062100" d="2220">And she does have her
own Food Network show,</p>
<p t="3064320" d="2280">but we just didn&#39;t actually
know about this restaurant</p>
<p t="3066600" d="1530">until day 12 of our trip.</p>
<p t="3068130" d="2340">So unfortunately it was a
bit too late to get there.</p>
<p t="3070470" d="3300">We also missed going to Nobu
for Chef Nobu Matsuhiso,</p>
<p t="3073770" d="2760">and we also missed Chica
by Chef Lorena Garcia</p>
<p t="3076530" d="840">at The Venetian,</p>
<p t="3077370" d="2250">who both have shows that
aired internationally</p>
<p t="3079620" d="2640">that we just straight up didn&#39;t
find until after filming.</p>
<p t="3082260" d="2190">Also, if Lisa Vanderpump counts,</p>
<p t="3084450" d="1590">I think the Wahlberg Brothers</p>
<p t="3086040" d="2820">and their Wahlburger&#39;s
restaurant probably counts too.</p>
<p t="3088860" d="2040">So those are the ones that
we&#39;re gonna have to hit</p>
<p t="3090900" d="1530">when we go back to Vegas,</p>
<p t="3092430" d="2040">I guess for part two of this video.</p>
<p t="3094470" d="2310">But as for the ones we
did actually eat at,</p>
<p t="3096780" d="1470">in terms of an outro here,</p>
<p t="3098250" d="2160">we figured the best thing
to do would be to list</p>
<p t="3100410" d="3090">our top fives of our favorites
for different categories.</p>
<p t="3103500" d="2250">These are not ranked in
any particular order.</p>
<p t="3105750" d="2460">They&#39;re just sort of the
best ones of each category</p>
<p t="3108210" d="1020">in our opinion.</p>
<p t="3109230" d="3540">First up, for best overall
experience, our favorites were</p>
<p t="3112770" d="2970">David Chang&#39;s Momofuku, we are
definitely going back there,</p>
<p t="3115740" d="2940">Gordon Ramsey&#39;s, Hell&#39;s Kitchen,
we had high expectations</p>
<p t="3118680" d="1770">and he did deliver pretty well,</p>
<p t="3120450" d="3270">Giada De Laurentiis&#39; Giada,
it&#39;s a favorite of ours.</p>
<p t="3123720" d="3690">Guy Fieri&#39;s Vegas Kitchen and
Bar, for the vibes and nachos</p>
<p t="3127410" d="2040">and Jose Andres&#39; Bazaar Meats,</p>
<p t="3129450" d="3180">very pricey but truly a
one of a kind experience.</p>
<p t="3132630" d="3120">For best dishes, our picks
were the sticky toffee pudding</p>
<p t="3135750" d="3150">at Hell&#39;s Kitchen, the
Yellowtail taco at Morimoto&#39;s,</p>
<p t="3138900" d="1710">the Brentwood Corn at Momofuku,</p>
<p t="3140610" d="2160">the Big Dipper sandwich at Guy Fieri&#39;s</p>
<p t="3142770" d="2310">and the Gazpacho at Tom Colicchio&#39;s,</p>
<p t="3145080" d="1650">because of the crunchy watermelon.</p>
<p t="3146730" d="2400">And then for best ambiance slash decor,</p>
<p t="3149130" d="2110">our favorites were Lisa Vanderpump&#39;s,</p>
<p t="3151240" d="3680">Vanderpump A Paris, again,
Giada De Laurentiis&#39; Giada,</p>
<p t="3154920" d="3210">Gordon Ramsey&#39;s Hell&#39;s Kitchen,
Roy Choi&#39;s Best Friend,</p>
<p t="3158130" d="2940">even though we didn&#39;t really
document it and Bazaar Meats,</p>
<p t="3161070" d="2910">because of the smoking
meats and smoking cocktails.</p>
<p t="3163980" d="1560">Now one final thought</p>
<p t="3165540" d="2880">that I have been holding my
tongue about this entire time,</p>
<p t="3168420" d="2580">if I were to give a
sweeping recommendation</p>
<p t="3171000" d="2370">to all of the celebrity chefs on our list,</p>
<p t="3173370" d="2100">it would be lighten up on the sprouts.</p>
<p t="3175470" d="1740">&#39;Cause it&#39;s sprout central over here.</p>
<p t="3177210" d="2940">There seems to be a
widespread sprouts obsession.</p>
<p t="3180150" d="1440">Sprouts, everyone loves sprouts.</p>
<p t="3181590" d="1530">- Everyone&#39;s putting
sprouts on everything.</p>
<p t="3183120" d="2100">- [Safiya] And after eating
a lot of them on our trip,</p>
<p t="3185220" d="1920">I got the mound of sprouts at the top.</p>
<p t="3187140" d="833">- [Tyler] Yeah.</p>
<p t="3187973" d="1087">- [Safiya] I would say I don&#39;t even think</p>
<p t="3189060" d="1050">they taste very good.</p>
<p t="3190110" d="2370">The one thing we really
gotta ask ourselves is,</p>
<p t="3192480" d="1230">did this pizza need sprouts?</p>
<p t="3193710" d="1380">- Absolutely not.</p>
<p t="3195090" d="3180">- Just 86 the sprouts,
like do we need this?</p>
<p t="3198270" d="2970">Okay, so that was a lot of
food and a lot of restaurants.</p>
<p t="3201240" d="2040">I know this wasn&#39;t a perfect experiment,</p>
<p t="3203280" d="3450">it was more like a lengthy
travel log of us eating a lot,</p>
<p t="3206730" d="1440">but I hope you guys enjoyed it.</p>
<p t="3208170" d="2400">Thanks to you guys for watching
