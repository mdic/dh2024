Okay, so you may be asking yourself,
Why are Josh and Ollie in a Rolls Royce.
It's because we're going 
to a very fancy restaurant.
So fancy, they told us they were gonna pick us up.
In a Rolls Royce.
A gold Rolls Royce.
Here we are, on our way to potentially 
the fanciest restaurant in Asia.
I am suddenly starving.
Me too.
Now that we're in the building.
I know it's 37 floors up,
but I feel like I can smell it.
Yeah.
39!
This way please.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Oh look at that!
That's all wine.
That is a wall of wine.
Thank you very much.
43!
We're going literally to the 
top of this enormous building.
Oh my gosh.
Okay.
We are in the flipping dome,
- of the top of the building.
- Apparently it's the second biggest  
chandelier in the world.
That there?
Oh my gosh, I didn't even see the chandelier.
Look at that!
What?
I'm so glad I'm wearing rich 
person camouflage right now.
I'm literally invisible.
You're an idiot.
Guys, this is insane.
What is life?
I'm just nervously laughing.
I have no words.
Do they know who we are?
Good evening,
Would you like some champagne before dinner?
- Sure.
- I wouldn't say no.
If you insist.
Are you going to try the champagne, Ollie?
No, no.
It's going to be good.
I'll taste it.
Is it good?
Wow, yeah.
Yeah, that's very good.
That's very good.
To us.
To...
To...
This is so surreal.
So here's our bread trolley.
I would like all of them.
- I kinda wanna try one of everything.
- I love bread.
Here we have our butter selection.
One is salted,
and the other is unsalted.
I love a bit of salty butter.
Oh wow!
Goodness me!
We haven't even started on 
the food yet and already...
I didn't breathe while he was doing that!
Wow!
Look at that!
Goodness me!
Mini croissant?
Oh it's so light!
It's perfect.
It's so light and fluffy.
Mmm.
I feel like I would tell Lizzie.
I had this dream I was on a 
really romantic date with Josh.
Okay.
Okay.
I hope that's not a 
conversation that happens often.
I was on a really romantic date.
She's like, "Oh, that's nice."
With Josh.
Good evening. x2
Hello.
I'm Julien.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Chef Julien.
For your first, to get your appetite going,
Oh.
Oh.
Whoa.
This one is uni with lardo and coffee.
For the non-uni,
I prepared for you two shrimp balls.
- Wonderful.
- Amazing.
My pleasure.
Thank you so much.
Enjoy your dinner.
Chef just came out.
He introduced the dish in person!
What's uni?
Uni is sea urchin.
Uni is nomally a really intense flavour.
He's given this to us basically right off the bat.
And then gold flakes.
Alright.
French chef playing to type.
Yeah, intense flavours, they love it.
Whoa!
Really intense like sea flavour,
but so creamy.
That biscuit on the bottom,
maybe that was the coffee biscuit.
Biscuit was doing some heavy lifting there.
Definitely the best fish cake I've ever had.
Doesn't really feel right 
to call that a fish cake.
- It was basically an uni ball,
- It was on a biscuit base.
instead of a meatball.
Now, shrimp ball.
Wow.
Okay.
That's so good.
It's a shrimp ball in spicy mayo.
But...
It's perfect.
It's perfect.
It tastes how you imagine 
it, but five times better.
Oh, dome, that's good.
Okay, you were saving that one.
Oh my gosh, I need to wash that down.
Here comes Julien.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
For your second dish is a signature dish,
a king crab on the bottom of your caviar,
with lobster jelly.
And the point is cauliflower cream.
This one is one dish Mr. Robuchon created,
more than 40 years ago.
- 40 years ago?
- Wow!
Thank you so much.
This is beautiful.
You're an artist.
We try, we try.
- Thank you so much.
- Bon appetit.
It's perfect.
How can you eat that?
That's the most beautiful 
thing I've ever been served.
You could frame that.
- Yeah.
- Put it up on the wall.
Probably in the last couple of days 
because it would start to go mouldy.
Oh, it jiggles!
It jiggles!
The posher a restaurant is,
the more jelly there is.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
I don't know if I can.
- Watch me.
- I just want to frame it.
Wow, that was extremely undignified.
I think you just touched it with your hand.
There's a fork as well,
so you don't have to do that.
Wow.
Oh my gosh.
It just keeps going.
So much flavour.
That is so fishy!
In the best possible way.
It just tastes like fishy cream.
Fishy cream.
Which doesn't sound good.
Lobster flavoured cream.
Lobster cream.
- Sounds a bit weird.
- Also weird.
Oh, Julien.
What?
This one is langoustine ravioli,
Mr. Robuchon created this recipe,
because he started to travel in Asia.
When he came back,
he had the idea to make the ravioli,
look like a dumpling.
What is a little bit different is,
we put foie gras sauce.
Beautiful.
Whoa!
Langoustine and black truffle inside.
Oh wow.
It's gone. It's gone.
The foie gras sauce you think is going 
to be overpowering is not at all.
It subtly compliments the flavours.
Dome-it. That is so good.
Shut up.
That's like that's an emotional dish.
It packs a punch like Jean-Claude Van Dome.
Stop, stop.
I've had too much wine.
Truffle really compliments.
Who are you calling?
You're calling Mr. Z.
Z!
He answered!
Hi guys.
How you doing?
Why are you in a tux?
Firstly, we're missing you here.
That is the second biggest 
chandelier in the world.
At the top of the Grand Lisboa,
like the most iconic famous hotel in Macau.
We're in a three Michelin star restaurant,
that's had its three stars for 15 years.
This is a Linguist... Linguistine?
Langoustine.
Langoustine Ravioli.
- It's the best pasta I've ever had.
- Okay, calm down.
- And it was made by a French chef in Macau.
- Stop, stop.
How?
That's not possible.
Does it taste 3 stars?
Oh, this experience...
300.
It's a whole constellation.
Wow. x5
So good to see you, man.
- I missed you.
- Enjoy your dinner.
We'll see you soon.
Ciao!
Enj...
Oh, I hung up on Z.
Oh my gosh.
With the local vegetable,
we have some beautiful green peas,
you have some bok choy,
and after we're making a bisque,
but we're making it the same as a fish soup.
Fantastic.
And what's the bubbles?
It's a fennel cream.
- Thank you.
- Wow.
Every dish here has felt like,
it could be hung in the Louvre.
Sometimes you go to a restaurant and you think,
"Oh, a bit of practice, I could cook that."
Yeah, this is yeah.
That's a really good point.
I look at this and I go,
"How do you make foam?"
A lot of practice I would struggle to cook that.
Is it like you're in a bubble bath,
and you just put more in and go like that?
Well this is,
this is a dome of lobster right there.
It is staring me in the face.
Dome it!
Dome it.
Tres bien.
Tres bien.
Maybe before the foam pops,
we need to get stuck in with the bubbles?
I want to have a bit of this.
What is that?
I have no idea what that is.
Oh, it's so meaty.
Oh, that is a lobster claw.
Let's do it.
Heck yeah.
Beautifully meaty.
I think this might be the third 
time we've had lobster this week.
It's also the third time we've had caviar.
Shut up.
Are you serious?
Yeah, you know, I was nervous when we arrived,
but I think I'm used to this now.
Okay, you need to chill out.
You need to take a chill pill.
Are you ready for your second main course?
Oh wow.
So still have room right?
- Yeah, of course.
- Of course.
Definitely.
If it's for food here,
I will just keep eating forever.
I'll keep eating until I die.
Oh gosh.
Oh wow.
The box is smoking!
- Yes.
- Oh, it's smoking a lot.
Do you guys have fire alarms here?
Yes.
Yeah, but don't worry.
It's only for the black smoke.
Oh my gosh!
Poor old Roman.
Is it really heavy?
You're hunched forward quite a lot.
He goes to the gym every week.
Oh yeah?
One of our signature dishes,
it's a Beef Rossini,
with beef and foie gras.
But for this version we 
decide to cook them together.
Half beef, half foie gras.
This one is the famous mashed potato.
Oh!
Mr. Robuchon became very famous in France,
and in the world for this mashed potato.
- Really?
- Yes.
The time has come.
Oh wow, look at that.
Cheers mate.
So much flavour.
It's like a neutron star of flavour.
Okay.
You just Oppenheimered your taste buds.
I've got to try this mash.
Oh my gosh.
Mmm.
Oh my gosh.
That is the best mashed potato I've ever had.
Never have I cared less that 
I'm allergic to potatoes.
You should stop eating that.
- You should stop eating that.
- This is incredible.
Somebody needs to try this.
Wow...
Yeah.
I think I should try that one,
- just to make sure, they're the same.
- No, no, no, you get some mash.
Have some mash, have some mash.
Have some mash.
That mash.
That's a British person,
- who loves mashed potato.
- Yeah.
I think this trip has just like,
ruined any other meal I might ever have.
Yeah.
This mash is incredible.
You're gonna hate me for saying this.
Oh, what are you gonna say?
It is better, but it is reminiscent,
of the mash you get in IKEA.
Right?
You've had... right?
No!
Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi play football.
I also play football.
Exactly.
Now in the moment I could score a wonderful goal.
Yeah, Luke could score a Messi-like goal.
Like, it's not beyond him.
Thank you,
I appreciate that.
But much like IKEA,
it would be a lot cheaper to sign you,
- for your team.
- Yeah.
And the difference is,
Luke's gonna score out once in his lifetime,
whereas Messi will do it once a week.
Messi!
Macau.
Amazing place.
Turns out David Beckham genuinely 
knows what he's talking about.
So the first day was Jade Dragon.
Oh my gosh.
-Three Michelin stars.
- It's a strange material to make a dragon out of,
because it's very heavy.
- Three Michelin star,
- Dragons have got to fly.
Chinese food.
That was literally just a 
little taste of what's to come.
It really was.
It is going to be hard to 
reintegrate back into normal life,
because we have been utterly 
spoiled over the last week.
If you haven't caught every 
episode, you should go back,
start from the beginning.
Every single meal we've had here,
I feel like has just been a revelation.
The egg tarts.
Oh my gosh.
People often think of them like how 
you think of Vegas or like gambling.
We haven't gambled at all since we've been here.
We gambled with our digestive system.
There's so much more to be had.
so much more to be experienced and tried,
when you're here in Macau.
And it is 100% worth the journey.
So some cheese after the main course.
Some cheese?
- Wow.
- That's a lot of cheese.
Yes.
- Paul!
- We can't have all of it.
Well, hey, don't say can't.
Okay.
We probably shouldn't.
So we have the Mimolette,
we have the Brillat-Savarin,
Reblochon,
the strong Epoisses.
Oh, we had this in a video.
This one's banned on French transport.
Oh!
- I forgot how strong it is.
- Strong, strong.
These are my favourite!
Those are the Carr's!
And we have some bread for your cheese.
Did somebody tell you that,
- these are his favourite snack in the world?
- Oh really?
I have these plain.
Surely, Adam, surely you told them.
No, no, no.
Wow.
- I feel like we should start with the Brie.
- Definitely.
Oh my gosh.
- It's like cream cheese.
- It's literally like cream cheese.
Cheers, mate.
- Mm.
- Oh wow.
Cream cheese?
What the heck?
That's brie!
That is so easy going.
- We should probably wrap up this video, man.
- We should.
We've been here for three and a half hours.
How do you end a video like this?
I suppose simply to say thank you to Julien,
to Paul and Roman,
and to everyone who cooked 
and served us this evening,
and to everyone in Macau who's looked after us.
It's been an amazing trip.
I really, really want to come back one day.
I actually don't want to go home.
I'm sad to leave.
Gabie's probably going to watch this.
Look, I want to bring Gabie here.
I don't want to go back, you know what I mean?
Yeah, OK.
Wow, Macau.
Mmm.
You're just eating...
Sorry, I'm spitting everywhere.
You are just eating,
a dry cracker at the end of this entire meal.
You're eating a plain Carr's cracker.
That is the most Ollie thing I 
have ever seen in my entire life.
Well, on that note,
We'll see you jolly soon.
