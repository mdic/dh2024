It’s been voted best in 
Japan for six years running.
That means getting a reservation 
is gonna be a pain in the ketsu,
if you catch my drift.
Say hello to Tokyo.
It’s a city of extremes.
With 37 million people, it’s the 
world’s largest city by population.
If you think New York never sleeps,
you should try this place.
When it comes to food, you 
cannot do much better than Tokyo.
There are more options here than 
you can shake a chopstick at.
And more michelin star restaurants 
than anywhere else on earth.
For me, it’s a tough decision.
There are so many great choices here
But today, I will not be 
using Michelin as my guide.
I’m using the Japenese restaurant 
and food guide called Tabelog.
The ratings come from Japanese 
customers, not inspectors.
And since we’ve come so far, it only 
makes sense to go straight to number one.
In the top spot is a place called 
Nihonbashi Kakigara-cho Sugita.
Or just Sugita for short.
This is Takaaki Sugita.
He’s the owner and Itamae,
or head sushi chef.
The inspiration came in high school
when he got hooked on a TV drama
about a guy who becomes an 
apprentice at a sushi restaurant.
It pushed him to take a 
part-time job as an apprentice,
and there he spent the next 12 years!
Working on his knife skills and learning 
Edomai sushi from the inside out.
It’s the traditional Tokyo style sushi 
that dates back to the 19th century.
It features small servings of fresh fish 
or seafood on top of small beds of rice.
So after apprenticing for 12 
years, something amazing happened.
His boss threw him the keys 
to one of his restaurants.
It was Sugita’s to run.
And he did just that for the next 10 years.
After a decade of running 
his own spot, he was ready.
At the age of 40, he took over the restaurant 
owned by his wife’s family and made it his own.
The name would come from his surname
Sugita.
To not confuse it with other Sugita restaurants,
he added the name of the neighborhood
Nihonbashi Kakigaracho.
It was an instant hit.
In 2017 he got the first Michelin star,
In 2022, the second one.
But in the latest Michelin guide for Japan, 
you cannot find this restaurant anywhere.
The fine dining community is buzzing 
about it all over the internet.
And it seems the reason is because 
of how difficult it is to get a seat.
Reservations are taken on a monthly basis
and open up the first Monday of each month.
And they do it the old-fashioned way
by phone.
Most of the seats are taken by regulars,
and if you know one of them, this is 
the best way to get a reservation.
This is how I got here.
Kentaro “Henry” Nakahara.
Henry is a chef and restaurant owner with
a grilled meat restaurant and 
a burger place here in Tokyo.
He eats at Sugita every month.
If you don’t know a regular, then a well-tipped 
concierge from a luxury hotel is your best bet.
And the best way to catch the newest Alexander 
the Guest episodes is to be a subscriber.
If you haven’t done that yet, go for it.
It will help us a lot.
Reservations at Sugita are so 
low in supply and high in demand,
it’s created it’s own black market.
People have paid up to 2000 euros just 
to get a seat at Sugita-san’s counter.
But don’t get any sneaky ideas.
You need to bring your ID to prove you’re you.
And if they catch you scalping your reservation,
you will never get another one.
All of this funny business with reservations was 
likely a turnoff for the Michelin inspectors.
And they simply dropped the 
restaurant from the guide.
Which is not uncommon here in Japan.
Two other famous sushi places had a similar fate
when they kept reservations 
away from the general public.
Sushi Saito is one.
The other is Sukiyabashi Jiro.
This is where Obama famously went.
You might remember it from the 2011 
documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
Let’s forget about Michelin and other 
restaurants and get back to Sugita.
All you really need to know is 
they won a boatload of awards
and have been ranked number one 
sushi restaurant six years running.
If you manage to get yourself a reservation, 
there are some rules you need to follow.
They are listed on the website, 
but let me paraphrase for you.
First one is no surprise.
Dress up a bit.
No shorts, flip-flops, jerseys, 
or other casual clothes,
and for god’s sake, take your hat off.
And save your sprays.
No strong fragrances are allowed.
You gotta go with the flow.
If you have a long list of 
allergies OR food dislikes,
your reservation might be refused.
Because more than 15 minutes late means
no sushi for you.
Your reservation will be cancelled.
Finally put your phone away.
We had to ask permission very very nicely.
From the outside, you would 
not know this place was famous.
In fact, you would likely walk right by it.
Sugita is well hidden on a quiet side street.
There are no G-Wagons or Aston Martins 
outside to give it away either.
Only the chef’s humble Honda 
scooter waits for his return.
Entering through the curtains,
it opens up into a cozy but welcoming space.
It has a minimalist design which is no 
surprise for a traditional Japanese restaurant.
An elegant counter made of 
hinoki wood is ready for action.
And in front, space for 9 lucky people,
each with a front row seat.
If you want a more private experience, 
there is also a side room for four people.
That’s a total of 13 seats.
Once inside, we steady ourselves 
for the best sushi in the world.
5 to 8 bite size appetizers and 11 or 
12 pieces of nigiri sushi are coming.
All this for 340 euros.
Before the show,
we see the staff working hard to make sure 
everything is perfect and ready to go.
Here we see a sous chef grating 
wasabi root to go with tonight’s meal.
Wasabi root is insanely 
expensive for a good reason.
It is near impossible to grow.
It needs shade, rich soil 
that is moist but not wet,
and steady temperatures between 9 and 16 degrees.
It’s grows naturally in river valleys in 
Japan, South Korea and parts of Russia.
That means most of the 
world’s wasabi is imitation.
The green stuff in those little packs is
horseradish, mustard, food coloring 
and a tiny amount of wasabi dust.
Fun fact about grating wasabi root.
First of all, the top of the 
board must be made of shark skin.
And grating should be done 
with an inward movement,
because inward means balance.
The meal begins with some snacks.
This is like the opening act and we really 
see the chef show off his knife skills.
And THAT is a knife.
Here Sugita-san is preparing our first dish.
Braised abalone.
It’s a type of sea snail.
It’s also known as sea ears.
And that makes sense.
It’s buttery and salty and has the chewiness 
of calamari but the texture more like scallop.
It has nice earthy umami flavors.
As you can see, everything is 
done with beautiful precision.
Every slice, every motion, 
it’s mesmerizing to watch.
And you can tell Sugita-san has done 
this hundreds of thousands of times.
Up next is surf clam.
This is found in northern Japan 
and can live more than 30 years.
Even the clams live a long healthy life here!
You’ve probably seen this before.
The Japanese traditional way 
of fixing glass and pottery.
They use lacquer to put it back together
And decorate the break with 
gold,silver or platinum.
They do this to highlight the 
special event in its history.
It’s called kintsugi.
It’s not a quick fix.
The process can take up to three months.
It’s part of the Japanese philosophy 
of accepting what’s not perfect.
It reminds us that we will 
all be broken at some point.
But not to give up.
These events become scars in our lives.
And we shouldn’t try to hide them.
The chef’s is preparing his signature maki roll.
Each piece was a party of 
textures with crisp seaweed paper,
soft rice, the delicate crunch of 
fresh chives and ultra tender sardine.
Together with the fresh wasabi and salty soy 
they created a beautiful harmony of flavors
I understand why it’s a signature dish.
It was incomparable.
Next we have sea urchin and salmon roe
We also try monkfish liver with hinotori sake
Sugita has 30 different kinds of 
sake here, from all over Japan.
Without question only the best 
quality ever makes it to my cup.
Can you mix champagne and sake?
Not in the same glass of course.
I found the sake made my palette more sensitive.
So when I went back to champagne, 
I saw a totally new side of it.
Such a bonus!
Coming shortly after is 
grilled seabass with citrus.
It’s so delicious that Henry is moved to tears.
I reach out with a bit of support.
Our final appetiser is 
chawanmushi with herring roe.
This looks like soup but 
it’s actually steamed egg.
It’s umami-rich and the texture is luxurious.
Appetisers done.
Now it’s time for nigiri.
balls of rice topped with raw fish.
Our first one is Iwashi, or Japanese sardine.
Sugita-san is so elegant.
He has rhythm like he is dancing
and every move he makes 
seems to be in slow motion.
As you can see, we are eating 
nigiri the traditional way
with our hands.
When it hits my plate I reach confidently…
And I fumble it.
Shit.
I hope Sugita-san didn’t see!
Although the presentation was ruined, the 
nigiri itself was still absolutely perfect.
Warm tangy rice and the most tender, delicious 
fish you ever tasted, with a hint of saltiness.
This is a fascinating world, but 
there are many things I don’t know.
Like what exactly this is.
Or this.
And I can’t really describe 
what is happening on my tongue.
So I silently respect the depth of this cuisine
to which I can no longer see.
What I do know is that each of 
these is gorgeous in many ways.
The delicate flavors,
the elegant textures,
the careful presentation will be 
seared into my memory for life.
It’s as close to tradition 
and perfection as you can get.
The fact that this sushi has been made exactly 
this way for over 200 years is really special.
Every move, every cut has been 
passed down for generations.
Here I can connect with it through the food.
On a personal level, this is important.
I was also lucky to share 
the table with an expert.
Henry not only translated but 
filled in the knowledge gaps.
Making it a history lesson 
and food experience in one.
I loved unlocking a new side of champagne 
using the sake to loosen up my tastebuds.
It was great fun to experiment 
with these two magical potions.
In this traditional, quiet place, 
I actually had a lot of fun.
At times I felt like a fish out of water, 
but still I was very comfortable here.
Maybe because I knew I was in such good hands.
The result was a wonderful experience.
And memories I will treasure for years.
