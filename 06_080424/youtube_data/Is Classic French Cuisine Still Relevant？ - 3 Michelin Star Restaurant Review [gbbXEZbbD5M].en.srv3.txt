Some say you can’t beat the French in the kitchen.
But with the shifting sands of 
time, the old makes way for the new.
From molecular gastronomy to sustainable kitchens.
In this video we are looking for an answer,
Can old time French cuisine still be that good?
Welcome to Hong Kong.
One of the most unique cities in the world.
It’s made up of263 islands,
but all the action is 
concentrated in three places.
First, the Kowloon peninsula.
It’s one of the most densely 
populated places in the world,
and Hong Kong’s biggest residential area.
Then, there is Hong Kong island,
home to the financial district with the iconic 
skyscrapers and the historic Victoria park.
Finally, the biggest island - Lantau.
Here you’ll find Hong Kong Disney 
as well as the Giant Buddha.
Officially, the city is called Hong Kong 
SAR, or Special Administrative Region.
Technically, it’s Chinese,
but in this area they have separate legal 
systems from the rest of the country.
They have their own currency, their own passport,
and much of the official 
business here is done in English.
How did that happen?
Basically, China and Britain had a rift.
In 1898, China agreed to lease 
Hong Kong to Britain for 99 years.
In that time, Hong Kong grew into a major 
trading port and economic hub for Asia.
In 1997, it was handed back under a 
‘one country, two systems’ principle.
Full of both natural and man-made 
beauty, Hong Kong is a tourist hotspot.
In 2019, over 56 million people came to visit.
For that reason, hotels are everywhere.
And there is no shortage of high end options.
Including The Four Seasons.
This hotel is massive.
It’s a 45-storey building with almost 400 rooms,
including 54 luxury suites.
In the restaurant department, they score big.
With three Michelin starred 
restaurants under one roof.
One of them is our restaurant for today.
Caprice.
I head to the sixth floor and bump 
into Victor Petiot straight away.
The director of Caprice.
Just the man I want to see.
He gives me a table overlooking Victoria Harbour
and a lovely welcome drink from 
a small batch producer in France.
The interior here is a mix of 
antiques from France and China,
as well as custom pieces designed for this space.
It’s stunning and almost 
as beautiful as this view.
I’m a big fan of open kitchens, 
and here its all on display.
25 chefs are buzzing around in organized chaos.
It looks amazing.
I’m here today for lunch.
And I have 3 options.
The Set Lunch, the Signature 
menu and the Connaisseur.
I go for the signature for 350 euro (2,980 HKD).
It kicks off with a bread service.
Made from scratch of course.
I’ll take a sesame roll and a mini-baguette.
The wine list is magnifique and 
spans most of the Old and New World.
The wine pairing with lunch is four glasses
and goes for just over a 100 
euro, and I go with that.
The first wine in the pairing is a pinot 
gris from biodynamic Swiss producer,
Klus 177.
More and more, Switzerland is becoming 
a player in the wine industry.
That might not be the first 
thing that comes to mind,
but when you see it on a 
map, it totally makes sense.
This is probably the first 
time I try a swiss wine.
Our first course is a Chef’s signature dish.
Alaskan King Crab
Jelly mixed with fennel cream 
and Oscietra caviar from Kaviari.
With a bit of gold to jazz it up.
Salty, a tiny bit sweet, and there is 
just enough acid to balance it out.
Gold or no gold, it’s hard to 
go wrong with a signature dish.
And of course the chef nailed it.
Speaking of the chef, who is he?
That would be Guillaume Galliot.
When he was 12, he was 
already cooking for himself,
because he didn’t like the 
food at the school canteen.
Inspired by Ducasse and Röbuchon, 
he decided to become a chef.
He started by volunteering at local 
restaurants, offering to peel vegetables.
In return he just wanted to 
watch the magic in the kitchen.
After culinary school came a big jump.
Working for twin chefs 
Jacques and Laurent Pourcel.
At the Michelin-starred Jardin 
des Sens in Montpellier.
By the age of 23, he had seen the 
world from Europe to the Caribbean,
and started his journey in Asia.
In 2012, he got an opportunity in Macau.
He took over a steakhouse, and rebuilt 
it into a fine dining restaurant.
It was called “The Tasting Room”.
It took just 7 months to get the first star here.
In three years, they had two.
In 2013, Vincent Thierry, the 
head chef of Caprice resigned.
Caprice approached him with the 
opportunity, but it was a No from Galliot.
Four years later, things had changed, 
and Galliot accepted the position.
With an ambitious and competitive 
attitude, he set himself a goal.
In just two years, Caprice 
earned the ultimate accolade:
3 Michelin stars.
I’m in the best hands possible.
I capitalize on the wine list 
and order a special bottle.
Krug Grand Cuvee 161.
It’s a blend of 134 wines from 12 different years.
With the youngest from 2005, 
and the oldest from 1990.
Once it's bottled, It's stays in 
the Krug wine cellar for 7 years.
Now that this one has been in the 
bottle for 10 years, it’s perfect.
This channel is like a fine wine.
It gets better with age.
Hit subscribe so you don’t miss a drop.
Our next wine is a 2017 
chardonnay from Domaine Valette.
Notice the red seal on the label.
It’s French for Old Vines, and 
speaks to the quality of the grape.
Grape vines don’t last forever.
As they age, their output decreases 
but the quality gets better.
Just like us.
The oldest vines still used in wine production
are around a hundred and fifty years 
old, in Australia’s Barossa Valley.
What’s in there?
We will know in a second,
but the thing next to it gives it away.
Do you know what this tool is?
It’s called a truffle shaver.
Our next course is langoustine
seared in butter with mushroom and mint
in a signature yellow wine sauce.
and of course topped with lots and lots 
of precious white Piedmonte truffle.
The langoustine is just right and this sauce is 
so good I could drink it straight from a glass.
A rare Madiera wine is next.
It’s from 1875 but still has lots of life in it.
How can a wine that old still be good?
A combination of quality, process and storage.
and of course a big amount of 
sugar and acid helps a lot.
Winemaking on the Portuguese islands of Madeira 
dates back to the end of the 15th century.
Before heading to the New World or East Indies,
this was a common place for 
ships to stock up on supplies.
One of them was wine.
But not just any wine.
This was fortified with grape spirits.
And for good reason.
First, it kept the wine from 
spoiling over the long voyages.
Second, it boosted the alcohol, so the 
ships didn't have to store as much.
Later, they discovered the heat and movement 
of the ship gave the wine a unique flavor.
The sailors loved it, and by the end of 
the 17th century, so did everybody else.
This madeira is a malvazia so 
it’s sweeter but just as nice.
The server tells me this is the 
paired special for the next course.
Believe it or not, this is French onion soup.
Both hot and cold.
Hot soup, cold ice cream. One bowl.
My tastebuds go wild.
It reminds me of comfort food, but it’s not.
It’s fine-tuned to the max but 
the soul is still in there.
With the Madiera, it really comes alive.
Amazing dish.
The server says this next one is a show stopper.
Mashed potato and caviar.
Surrounded with the chef’s 
signature champagne sauce.
He tells us this is our one way ticket to heaven.
Interesting choice of words.
I’ve heard this before.
At another classic French 
restaurant with 3 Michelin stars.
Inside another Four Seasons Hotel.
Can you guess where?
That’s right.
Le Cinq.
And these two gentlemen came straight from there.
Every person I met who trained 
at Hotel George Fifth Paris
has been ultra-professional with 
elegance, movement and sophistication.
Without exception.
It’s more than a hotel.
It’s an educational institute in my opinion.
Some might not care about the little 
details, but I really admire them.
Take for example, how they dress.
Well dressed people.
Nice accessories here and there,
And bespoke shoes, which colors 
were inspired by Chateu D’Yquem
Turns out, it was true.
This is heaven.
The pairing of potatoes and caviar is a classic,
but its the sauce that made me swoon.
The ingredients are simple,
but they find balance in the champagne 
sauce, without overpowering the caviar.
I also enjoy the simpicity of the potato.
I’m not sure if they can top this.
To go with this course we enjoy a 
nice wine from the island of Corsica.
This one is a 2019 vermentino 
from Domaine de Vaccelli.
It has bright minerality and gentle spicyness
that works well with the 
creaminess in the heavenly dish.
I had a chance to visit the attached Caprice 
Bar and it has an amazing atmosphere.
Just like the restaurant, they 
are serious in what they do.
The cocktail menu changes every three months 
to represent the season’s best ingredients.
Next is wild caught sea bass in a light 
seafood consummé, with ginger and coriander.
Such beautiful presentation.
The wine is a 2011 riesling from 
the Alsace region of France.
Together they make a nice light pair.
With the main course coming, I am 
served a glass of Chateau d’Yquem.
One of the biggest wines in the world.
But this is a lush dessert wine.
So why is it served with our main course?
Often, a wine is chosen to 
complement a certain dish.
Here, they flipped the script.
Our server explains that the Chef created 
this duck dish to play with Chateau d’Yquem.
And he changes the dish to according 
to the vintage of the wine.
This one is from 1987.
The duck comes all the way from France,
and is cooked using a French technique
which keeps in the blood so 
the meat stays fresh and juicy.
Before carving we take a look.
It’s served with baby carrots, 
saffron and fresh mandarin.
It comes with a duck sauce dressed up with 
a special honey from the Sultan region.
More wine arrives well suited to duck.
This one is a 2021 Chambolle Musingy pinot noir.
The meat is succulent and tender and the 
vegetables keep it fresh and balanced.
This is as perfect as it can be.
Before dessert, another rich 
and warming dessert wine.
At this point, I’m full, and so is my table.
Look at all this wine!
But we aren’t done.
Next is a classic French cheese service.
From Creamy and extra creamy to strong 
and stinky and everything in between.
With dried apricots and 
walnuts to refresh the palette.
Looks delicious but it’s just too much for me.
The pastry team here at Caprice 
is made up of seven people.
So you know they are serious about sweets.
Let’s see if I can squeeze some in.
Here it is.
6 layers of sweet indulgence.
I love chocolate, so I make 
a little room for this one.
I love how they cap this cocoa sorbet 
with a bit of gold leaf luxury.
Amazing dessert.
As we are getting ready to go, 
we have a guest at our table.
Chef Galliot himself!
I always like a good chat with people like him.
He is in good humor, but you can tell 
he is serious about what he does.
With today’s lunch he’s proved it.
A true professional.
As the petit fours come, we know 
the end of our meal is really here.
Another home run from the pastry team.
These look more like ornaments than food.
The bill arrives, and my wallet becomes 
lighter to the tune of r 1400 euro.
So can an old time French 
restaurant still be THAT good?
From the service side, absolutely.
This was serious, precise, and 
fantastic service that you rarely see.
You can tell the local people were also 
trained on professional French hospitality.
They have created a perfect system.
Many try, but only a few really can.
And those who can will always 
have a place in gastronomy.
In my opinion, a classic, elegant French 
restaurant will never go out of fashion.
And Chef Galliot just confirmed it.
And that does it for this episode.
