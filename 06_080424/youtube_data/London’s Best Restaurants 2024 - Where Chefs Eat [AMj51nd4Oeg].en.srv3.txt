This film is all about the best places
to eat and drink in London right now.
That's smooth, baby.
We have interviewed over 130 of the
leading chefs, hospitality kingpins and
celebs on their favourite London spots.
And we've done a fair bit
of research ourselves.
We're super proud of this list,
everything from pizza to fine dining.
Over the next two days, we're going to
show you some of our most
loved spots in our hometown.
It's so good.
Hey, I'm Jesse behind the camera's
Will, and together we are TOPJAW.
If you're a Londoner and you haven't been
to the Regency cafe,
you're doing it wrong.
Now, we're probably not the first one to
tell you about this place, but
it's an absolute institution.
I'm having a really nice time in here.
It's a reasonably militant operation in
there, so I recommend
you get your order ready.
It's the first time for
both of us, isn't it?
No, I've been here before.
All right, fair enough.
No, just me, then.
No, I've been doing it wrong.
Even if you haven't been to
Regency, you might recognise it.
It's been a film set for so many things,
like Rocketman, Layer Cake, Brian Rock
and like loads of photo shoots and stuff.
It's a real time warp in here and
the prices feel pretty 1999, too.
We're paying like six quid for sourdough
bread these days in restaurants.
They'll do a whole
breakfast here for that.
Yay.
There's nothing they won't serve you.
You could just have a plate of beans
or beans or toast if you wanted to.
Dip the chip.
But we went for set breakfast and then the
black pudding, the mushrooms, the bubble
and squeak are extras that you can add on.
Bubble and squeak is like potato
and cabbage, mashed up, fried.
Tell you what, it's a
pretty good banger, innit?
We're still in the same family and
right now it's with Marco in charge.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Marco.
Best pizza.
Crisp.
Crisp, obviously.
Crisp pizza.
Worth the trip to W6.
It is Crisp.
Unbelievable pizza.
When asked where the best pizza in London
is, there is no doubt in
our mind, is there, Will?
It's not.
It's crisp.
And that's probably the quickest answer we
can give to any restaurant related
question that London threw at us.
Chefs love this place and it's not in
central town, it's out in W6, out in
Hammersmith, in a residential area.
It's a little sleepy pub has been for a
long time until Carl came
along with his magical pizza.
This is your nan's pub?
41 years.
40 years, February it would have been.
So this kind of feels like home to you.
Yeah, massively.
Here we go.
First pint of the 48 hours in.
It's not even 11:00 a.
m.
Yeah.
That's mental.
That's disgusting.
That's really bad.
Yeah.
Walk me through these components.
So how do you make italian
ingredients crisp up like you do?
It's just trial and error.
It was just years and years of trying.
Every flour, German American
flour, Italian flour.
I tried bottled water,
tap water, filtered water.
Tap water's the best.
And we use salt, obviously, and oil.
You know, Neapolitan places don't use, so.
But I think it's the
oil that crisps it up.
Where you starting?
Well, I haven't tried the Picante.
This was meant to be a little
limited edition, much like the Vecna.
Yes.
And then it went down really well.
Yep.
That's my favourite now.
Mmm.
That's nice.
Right, so this is the Vecna.
So this was a Halloween special
Vecna off of Stranger Things.
And this was the first and only
hot honey pizza that Carl did.
And it's really gone down a storm.
It's a lot of people's favourite.
Yeah, that's it.
It's always been my favourite.
Still the best pizza in London.
Jess, what were your top tips for
someone coming down to Crisp be?
It's not an impulse place.
Book it a couple of weeks in advance.
And when you do come,
Picante & Vecna, I reckon.
Yeah, Picante, Vecna.
Currently.
Don't know.
This is like Black Axe Mangal,
aka F.K.A.B.A.M.
It's approaching it's 10th year
of being an essential London restaurant.
Lee Tiernan spent many years as Head
Chef at St John Bread and Wines.
He's got great provenance, but it's in
this place he's let his
imagination really run wild.
Black Axe originated in Copenhagen.
It was a nightclub called Baggen.
We played really loud
music, people were moshing.
It was supposed to be just quick
kebabs, and it essentially was.
And by the time it came to open our own
spot, we couldn't think of another name
and we had quite a bit of traction,
so Black Axe Mangal stuck.
So Lee says this place isn't for everyone.
Absolutely no circumstance.
It's Coldplay.
What did you say?
Coldplay.
Oasis and The Cure.
Coldplay.
Oasis and The Cure.
Anyone plays, those are sacked.
I hope you're hungry, bruv.
Oh, my God, look at that.
That's smoked cod's roe.
You should cut into it fairly
soon before the yolk seizes up.
That's incredible.
This is one of my favourite salads
we've come up with recently.
It's a smoked pork neck
with a tomato sauce.
Do you need a plate?
For you, lamb waffle flatbread.
That's predominantly
liver and heart on there.
It's got testicles on it.
All you can really taste is, like,
really tender, soft lamb meat.
These are what you can smell when you
walked in all that, like, cumin and stuff.
I mean, they're not the most glamorous
thing to eat, but, hell, they are tasty.
One of my favourite things to do is to
eat food and not choose off the menu.
So original, so delicious.
If you're lucky enough to meet Lee.
Make sure you chew his ear
off and get some stories.
For the best burger in London question,
Black Bear does get called out sometimes.
But, nowhere near as much as it should.
It is so good.
Is it underrated?
Yes.
Is it the best burger in London?
Yes.
Narrowly, perhaps beaten
by Elliot at Lagom.
And that burger has to be tried, however,
bsolutelya banging, you know,
dirty, indulgent burger.
Black Bear is where I like to go.
Why did you start Black
Bear and why burgers?
Burgers was, like, at the centre and we
wanted to do the best burger
that we could, like, ever do.
People come for the burgers, but then they
try the sides and then that's
what they start talking about.
So we designed chicken
nuggets, brisket, sping rolls.
We do like this rare
bit crumpet now as well.
Yeah.
I always forget how good that is.
Give me that Death Row burger.
Thank you very much, dude mama.
But the proportions of this
single burger is just right.
Such beautiful beef you have that, like,
rich, velvety cheese
and the tangy onion jam.
I love how sesame heavy these buns are.
And they're made
specifically for Black Bear.
This is their beef brisket bun.
The beef is braised for
12 hours in beer, no less.
Little pink pickled onions,
garlic mayo, cheese.
I think we need to get out of here,
Will, or else we'll be keeling over.
Mate.
Next on the list.
Don't think we've been here before.
If you've even watched the smattering
of our stuff on Instagram or TikTok.
Best bar or pub?
I've been going to The
Devonshire quite a lot.
Have to be Devonshire.
The Devonshire.
Yay.
You'll be no stranger to the
fact that we love The Devonshire.
Yes.
Quite simply, poors an amazing
pint of Guinness, best Guinness you're
gonna get, at least in England, from
Dublin, please don't come hunting me.
But it's way, way more than just Guinness.
The food upstairs is fantastic.
Oisin Rogers, best publican ever, from The
Guinea, again, another great Guinness pub.
Was there for seven years as manager.
This is his own place.
The smell is starting to become
nostalgic to me, which is worrying.
This place has only been open three months
and I walk in and I'm
like, ah, I'm home, baby.
These are killer few things to start.
So, yeah, these nice chunky lardons and
the buttery scallops, it's
got a beautiful crunchy crumb.
This is the brawn toast.
And these are little pork ribs served with
a bit of embers, just to get that
extra smoky flavour up your schnoz.
Yes, the Guinness is fantastic and so are
the toasties and the steak sandwich and
the scotch egg and sausage
just downstairs in the bar.
And that's worth the trip alone.
But upstairs they're cooking on oak,
cooking on the embers and doing incredible
meat dishes and little
beautiful side plates like this.
Oh, my God.
That cut, that fat content.
We also don't have, like, real estate
for plates, so we're just raw dogging it.
Look, it's not easy to get a
table, but it is worth the fight.
In my opinion Bar Crispin, in our
interviews, comes up a
shockingly small amount.
Right.
I love this place.
It could be my most underrated in London.
Could maybe even be a contender
for my best restaurant in London.
Big on their wines and
their natural wines.
If you come as a four, just order
everything and then reload on
whatever you like the most.
It is tiny in there.
It's 14 seats, so we don't have enough
room for our four person crew, so we're
eating outside, but
fortunately, it's not too cold.
Right there we are
pacing ourselves and all.
Yeah, big balls over there got
a bottle of wine for himself.
Yeah, this is the prawn sando.
This is the prawn sando, dude.
Like, it's.
It's a great little starting dish.
Yeah, Cod's roe on very crispy
sourdough with hazelnut.
This tastes like really
high end bacon frazzles.
We've got smoked aubergine, creme
fraiche, jalapenos, the charred mackerel.
Get a bit of everything.
I mean, mackerel is pretty toilet
fish, do you know what I mean?
But the way they cook that, that sweet,
beautiful char on top,
this gorgeous little number here is
the aged beef tartare on a crumpet.
Everything's just, like,
really well presented.
And the pacing is like this.
They come out one dish at a time.
You eat it, you enjoy it, you move on.
So you almost have, like,
your own little tasting menu.
Oh, man, it's beautiful.
It's like cumin and curry leaf.
That's fantastic.
And then this pork rib, barbecue sauce.
Everything.
Everything they do is just
so goddamn interesting.
Where are we going, bro?
The Four Seasons.
Got a bit more space.
This is the jugi Four Seasons, and
we're here for Pavyllon and Bar Antoine.
On this one floor, you have
Pavyllon and you have Bar Antoine.
Bar Antoine.
You have the cocktails, you have wine.
They do these, like, Japanese bar snacks.
This whole place is a
Yannick Alleno restaurant.
It's got 15 Michelin stars.
It's a hugely successful
and celebrated chef.
This is his first London restaurant.
This is one of my favourites.
There's mezcal vodka, shiso leaf,
and, like, a pineapple reduction.
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, ooh.
Instant saliva, both sides of the mouth.
That is gorgeous.
It's like a really classy whiskey apple.
You're bringing out these cocktails
faster than we can consume them.
They're a little signature
here, cheese souffle.
But on top, they've put their
froie gras, which is tres sexy.
You can't get a more French dish.
100%, 110, maybe.
110% French.
Very Yannick, very gorgeous.
Oh, my goodness.
Beef fillet, pepper crust confit,
salted butter, and a cafe de prix sauce.
That is unreal.
Doesn't get more french than that.
So this right here is the chocolate
souffle with a bit of flambe amaretto at
the table, topped off with some
beautiful vanilla ice cream.
Oh, yikes.
Oh, come on.
It's like getting a...
Like, I need a dark room,
you know, some tissues.
Feel like I was probably a bit dressed
down to be in there, that sort of thing.
I really like that.
We need to have a nighttime hug.
Good morning, mate.
Now I'm here for Pophams, one of the
absolute, undoubtedly
best bakeries in London.
Best bakery Pophams, for sure, mate.
Yeah.
You know, Pophams.
Pophams bakery.
Pophams.
Pophams.
Just like the best time.
This is their London field site.
Doubles up in the evening
as a pasta restaurant, but.
Oh, my God.
Started about seven years ago by
the croissant whisperer Ollie Gold.
When and why did you start Pophams?
When?
October 2017.
On the basic premise of trying to be more
innovative and creative
with croissant dough.
You cant go wrong with like anything
really on their pastry team sheet like
these guys Schlossberger,
Schlossberg, Schlossberger
cheese, spring onion and marmite.
Oh hello.
Then we have this guy maple and bacon.
It's not little bacon bits it's just
actually quite thick cut bacon just
wrapped around and this their apple
crumble paired with Ozone
coffee expertly made.
It's so good.
If someone's visiting London and they
pop into Pophams, what should they get?
Essential order, black americano.
And then I would probably go
with this guy, cardamom bun.
Go and give it a tear.
So nice and gooey on the inside
and then you crunch into the top.
That was magnificent mate.
Now Pophams don't do wholesale.
Pophams only serve pastries in Pophams
so they're baking at like six, seven am.
So super duper fresh when
you're having it at 09:00 a.
m or 03:00 p.
m.
It hasn't been baked the day before and
that's important because that's where that
beautiful light,
unbelievable bake comes from.
Honestly I'd give anything to be here.
Old Compton street in the 60s from what
I've heard from people who were around
here at that time it was
basically a 24/7 party here.
Yeah.
And a few iconic spots remain who are
still flying the flag for what once was
like French House, Bar
Termini, Bar Italia.
But there is one place that long
predates those Algerian Coffee Stores.
Now this place has been here since 1887.
This shop's been the same ownership
since the forties dynamic sister duo.
So you have Marissa and Daniela.
Come on, come on.
You've worked it basically
your entire life.
I started when I couldn't see over the
counter and I had to have a little step so
I could use a till and
put things in the grinder.
Child labour.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, I think I got paid in chocolate.
Oh my treats go to
McDonald's on the corner.
Oh nice.
Over 80 coffees and 120 teas are
served from this little busy shop.
And what I really like is they're serving
coffees that are not
from the known growers.
They have like Australian coffee,
Malawi, Thai coffee, Vietnamese coffee.
This is one of those places that will
serve you a really high
quality espresso for £1.
20.
Little authentic original shops like
this in London are few and far between.
So I think it's really important that us
as we're here is to support
businesses like this.
Luke Hunns, Head Chef at Chilton
Firehouse, who we love dearly.
So his best burger in London was Manna,
like an American smash style burger.
And one of the places to
get those is an Arcade.
There are a few food rules like this in
London, but this is like
quite a well branded juji one.
Home to Manna, where we
want that smash burger.
But you've also got Indian
food, Cantonese, Nepalese.
There really is something for everyone.
This is the double platter.
I'm sure some people take
these down on their own.
Chicken tenders, waffle fries, three
little sauces, and some
gherkins for good measure.
Single patty smash.
Not too too thin.
Loads of gherkins, hot sauce.
Chip dip.
Oh, can we get a slow mo replay on that?
This is the normal Manna smash.
American style mustard pickles.
It's a very enhanced
nostalgic taste, you know.
Manna is one of the eight food vendors on
the ground floor upstairs in little
mezzanine Plaza, home to
some really spicy Thai.
Okay, so Luke Farrell from
Speedboat Bar, this is another one.
It hits this place, right?
It has a Michelin Bib.
It's seriously good food
and a pretty lowfi setting.
Right?
So this is a betel leaf around
the little cashew nut salad.
It's very fragrant, it's very
Thai, and a little bit spice.
How's it going, Krismas?
What are you doing?
What's this?
This one?
Massaman Beef.
Oh, this is your famous.
Yeah.
And it's the only one that people
can order downstairs as well?
Yes.
Without coming here.
Would you like to try one, though?
I have to.
Okay.
Please.
Yeah.
I mean, what I mean is.
Yes, please.
Krismas.
This is a beautiful hot sea bream dish.
We've then got a massaman
curry beef and potato.
They're beautiful, light,
melt in your mouth pork belly.
What's this spicy looking bastard?
This one's the spiciest on their menu.
That is the spiciest menu?
This is a seven spice chicken
curry, I think they call it.
This is some morning glory.
That's gonna help us with the spice.
We've got some fried eggs, some roti,
and of course, some nice fragrant rice.
Unapologetically authentic and original.
And it's just a flavour profile
that you don't get elsewhere.
Oh, no.
You f*cking bastard.
Okay, we're at The Connaught
Bar, now in our interview series.
So many chefs say this is the
best cocktail bar in London.
Best cocktail spot.
The Connaught Bar.
Come on.
The Connaught.
I like The Connaught.
Connaught Bar.
It's got everything you want,
I think, Connaught Hotel.
You've got to go down to the Connaught.
The Connaught Bar, I think, is amazing.
And yeah, there are lots of five star
hotels in London with beautiful bars.
What sets this place
out is Giorgio and Ago.
Okay, what are you going to order, mate?
What's going on?
I feel like I should have a
martini because yours are like.
Well, they're like mythological, you know?
I'd rather say iconic,
but mythological will do.
Yeah, it's a real.
Every martini at The
Connaught Bar is special.
We stir our very own
Connaught gin 75 millilitre.
And then we have a blend of three
different dru vermouth  to add
dryness as well as complexity.
We have a selection of five
different bitter essences.
We paint the glass with our bitter.
Don't forget to smile.
Look at that.
What the hell was that?
I've got skills.
I've chosen my bitters.
I went for Tonka, a
mouthy lemon and an olive.
Cause I'm special, apparently.
That's smooth, baby.
That is.
I mean, it doesn't really taste like
you're drinking completely neat booze.
It's a.
It's a refined and elegant
cocktail, my friend.
I've been told.
So magnetum is the
marriage of two elements.
We have a clarified milk punch on the
bottom based on dry sherry,
lavender, lemon verbena on top.
We have scotch whiskey
together with sweet sherry.
So this is a magnetum.
I'm about to drink it in
the world's fifth best bar.
Jesus Christ.
I could have that on intravenous drip.
I think there's a lot of booze in there
and it tastes like a
lovely, beautiful meadow.
Oh, that's so good, that one.
That's brilliant.
Okay.
Carnaby street.
Super central, super touristy.
But there's a little thing
here called Kingly Court.
All food places.
Most people just hit the ground floor, but
right here in Donia, beautiful
Filipino home cooking.
The other very gorgeous Florence Mae.
This is her restaurant.
It's just flavour profiles that
I haven't had anywhere else.
That's all I'm gonna say.
This is their signature
cocktail, the pepino.
Oh, that's good.
Gin, lime, cucumber and coconut serum.
About time we had a cocktail.
This is their prawn and pork dumplings.
White crab on top in a brown butter sauce.
Oh, you didn't see nothing.
You didn't see nothing.
Love that.
Let's go for some sea bream ceviche with
avocado cream and chive
oil and a bit of chilli.
Oh, I can't wait to get involved.
So this is the turbot Bicol express.
Bicol is a region of the Philippines, and
it's like a known spicy
coconut creamy sauce.
And again, this is pork lechon.
Oh, my goodness.
In, like, a liver peppercorn sauce.
Go and look at the state of this lobster.
Yeah, butternut squash, coconut.
Hello.
Cheers, bro.
Let's go for it.
Ube choux.
This is a choux pastry.
In it is ube ice cream.
Ube is this sweet potato.
Very popular Filipino dessert.
Donia, you're brilliant.
Really like you and your ube choux.
For our final stop of tonight and this
film and it's wonderful journey, we're
checking into our beloved
cocktail bar, SOMA.
Okay, so upstairs is Kricket,
an Indian restaurant.
One of Will's absolute faves down here.
This is their, like,
speakeasy cocktail bar.
Their cocktail menu does have
also that Indian influence.
So we've ordered a turmeric
cocktail with sesame oil.
And we're going for a Chaat,
which is like an Indian margarita.
In your Chaat, you have mezcal chat,
masala, gooseberry and kumquat.
But one of my favourite
words to say, cheers, sister.
And I have a Turmeric, which is vodka,
sesame oil, turmeric and lemon syrup.
Damn, I got The Leaf
right, which is a fear gin.
Curry leaf.
Curry leaf, lime leaf and pink peppercorn.
It's called a cashew.
It's like their version of Negroni.
So you have mezcal, campano
bitters, burnt cashew and vermouth.
Oh, man.
SOMA's got a whole lot of
love on our chef interviews.
Best cocktail bar.
Best bar.
It has a very unassuming entrance.
Everyone gets a hard on for.
You know what I mean?
Good night, everyone.
Big love.
Okay, see you next time.
Bye.
