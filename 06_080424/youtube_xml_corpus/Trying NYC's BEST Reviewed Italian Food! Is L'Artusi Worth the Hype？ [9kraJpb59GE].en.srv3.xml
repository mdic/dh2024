There are loads of great eats, including both Italian American red sauce spots and authentic Italian restaurants in NYC. When it comes to the best Italian restaurant in NYC, many will say it's the exclusive Rao's or Carbone in the West Village that are the best Italian spots in New York. However, those are mostly based off reputation. That Rao's is the most exclusive restaurant in NYC is part of the appeal, and Carbone lost its Michelin star last year which could also be showing that Carbone is overrated to many people. When basing off reviews, however, other restaurants come up as the best Italian joint in NYC, most notably I Sodi and L'Artusi.&#10;&#10;As we were unable to get into Carbone, we decided to settle for not the highest clout restaurant in New York but the best rated Italian restaurant in NYC. L'Artusi has the most positive reviews out of any other Italian restaurant in town, with around 1,500 reviews and a 4.6 rating, a great accomplishment in a city as selective about food as New York! Join us as we try L'Artusi for the first time. Will it live up to the ratings or is it also overrated at this point? We will put the famous L'Artusi spaghetti, L'Artusi olive oil cake and the L'Artusi focaccia to the test!&#10;&#10;Like and Subscribe if you like my vids!&#10;&#10;Restaurant Deets:&#10;L'Artusi&#10;228 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014" fulltitle="Trying NYC's BEST Reviewed Italian Food!

  <p time="23279" is_ac="true">trying to get into Carbone for a while</p>

  <p time="27000" is_ac="true">to get a reservation and walk in almost</p>
  <p time="29519" is_ac="true">impossible on top of that some people</p>
  <p time="31560" is_ac="true">say that Carbone is overrated after all</p>
  <p time="33719" is_ac="true">it lost its Michelin star last year and</p>

  <p time="37980" is_ac="true">you read the comments but today I</p>
  <p time="40200" is_ac="true">decided to take you guys to the next</p>
  <p time="42059" is_ac="true">best thing maybe even better which is</p>
  <p time="44399" is_ac="true">not the most famous Italian restaurant</p>
  <p time="46200" is_ac="true">but the highest rated one on Google and</p>
  <p time="49020" is_ac="true">that is how do I say this lartusi</p>
  <p time="51920" is_ac="true">lartusi now this place might not have</p>
  <p time="54239" is_ac="true">the brand recognition of carbon but</p>
  <p time="56520" is_ac="true">unlike Carbone it has a 4.5 rating on</p>
  <p time="59280" is_ac="true">Google and and over 1500 reviews that's</p>
  <p time="62460" is_ac="true">pretty good for so many reviews anyways</p>

  <p time="93600" is_ac="true">outdoor seating sort of indoor space</p>
  <p time="95579" is_ac="true">hybrid components let's take a look at</p>
  <p time="97380" is_ac="true">the menu now I am super not cultured I</p>
  <p time="100140" is_ac="true">don't know how to say this lar tusi</p>

  <p time="112040" is_ac="true">unfortunately I cannot eat crab so I</p>
  <p time="114899" is_ac="true">can't get the bucatini Nero but when I</p>
  <p time="117420" is_ac="true">was not allergic at the time this would</p>
  <p time="118979" is_ac="true">have been pretty good but I also hear</p>
  <p time="120899" is_ac="true">good things about this spaghetti and I</p>
  <p time="122939" is_ac="true">hear it's really like a different take</p>
  <p time="124799" is_ac="true">from the red sauce spaghetti that most</p>
  <p time="126420" is_ac="true">people are used to so you know I'm</p>

  <p time="142500" is_ac="true">they have it and it's not just a dinner</p>

  <p time="177120" is_ac="true">bit different</p>
  <p time="178560" is_ac="true">the parmesan stop so it's going to be</p>

  <p time="209760" is_ac="true">described everything beautifully uh you</p>
  <p time="212400" is_ac="true">can really detect that he kind of has</p>
  <p time="213900" is_ac="true">some passion for the menu and for the</p>
  <p time="215580" is_ac="true">restaurant so far I gotta say I'm</p>
  <p time="217560" is_ac="true">excited for the food but the service is</p>
  <p time="219540" is_ac="true">Top Notch services and everything you</p>
  <p time="222180" is_ac="true">know I grew up eating at some more dingy</p>
  <p time="224459" is_ac="true">Chinese restaurants so I always</p>
  <p time="226200" is_ac="true">prioritize taste over service but it</p>
  <p time="230159" is_ac="true">absolutely helps and it definitely helps</p>
  <p time="231840" is_ac="true">to make a good impression so can't wait</p>
  <p time="234120" is_ac="true">to eat</p>
  <p time="235620" is_ac="true">okay so we just got our first item</p>
  <p time="238560" is_ac="true">focaccia bread when they brought it at</p>
  <p time="241260" is_ac="true">first I almost thought this was like</p>
  <p time="242819" is_ac="true">cornbread just the way they cut it and</p>
  <p time="244920" is_ac="true">the way it looks but this Focaccia looks</p>
  <p time="247680" is_ac="true">really really good I like the artistic</p>
  <p time="249720" is_ac="true">way they cut it and the way it's baked</p>
  <p time="251700" is_ac="true">it's got some nice garlic and herbs</p>
  <p time="254159" is_ac="true">baked right into the crust and I'm</p>
  <p time="256019" is_ac="true">guessing this is like a spicy olive oil</p>
  <p time="258180" is_ac="true">that accompanies it let's give it a try</p>
  <p time="260519" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="266880" is_ac="true">oh wow</p>
  <p time="270199" is_ac="true">wow I gotta say that's some pretty good</p>
  <p time="272699" is_ac="true">Focaccia the best part especially is</p>
  <p time="275340" is_ac="true">this part on Top this charge baked</p>
  <p time="277800" is_ac="true">garlic and herbs on top the bottom half</p>
  <p time="279840" is_ac="true">tastes nice and spongy like a decently</p>
  <p time="282300" is_ac="true">good baked bread but this top part is</p>
  <p time="284759" is_ac="true">just so salty and garlicky and Herby</p>
  <p time="287699" is_ac="true">it's just amazing I kind of just almost</p>
  <p time="290160" is_ac="true">want to eat the tops like have you guys</p>
  <p time="291780" is_ac="true">seen that Seinfeld episode where I think</p>
  <p time="293400" is_ac="true">it was George who proposed a startup</p>
  <p time="295020" is_ac="true">where you only sell muffin tops they</p>
  <p time="297300" is_ac="true">should only sell the top of the focaccia</p>
  <p time="301820" is_ac="true">although I think that was not the right</p>
  <p time="304139" is_ac="true">move when you only eat the top it's a</p>
  <p time="306419" is_ac="true">little bit too buttery a little bit too</p>
  <p time="308040" is_ac="true">intense in flavor I guess you really</p>
  <p time="309720" is_ac="true">really do need to pair it with the bread</p>
  <p time="312060" is_ac="true">on the bottom let's try it with the</p>
  <p time="314280" is_ac="true">olive oil why don't we</p>
  <p time="320780" is_ac="true">hmm</p>
  <p time="322320" is_ac="true">you know actually that's not olive oil</p>
  <p time="324060" is_ac="true">at all it's some sort of like a pepper</p>
  <p time="326759" is_ac="true">sauce water it tastes nice but to be</p>
  <p time="329759" is_ac="true">honest I kind of prefer the Focaccia on</p>
  <p time="331979" is_ac="true">its own it's good though maybe you'll</p>
  <p time="333360" is_ac="true">like it</p>
  <p time="336419" is_ac="true">I will say though it's a little bit</p>
  <p time="338039" is_ac="true">chilly being outside I'm not sure if</p>
  <p time="340560" is_ac="true">sitting outside was the right call they</p>
  <p time="342780" is_ac="true">do have these heat lamps but it's not</p>
  <p time="344400" is_ac="true">really positioned directly above me so</p>
  <p time="346500" is_ac="true">let's warm up why don't we Sorry New</p>
  <p time="348780" is_ac="true">Yorkers ride or die all right spaghetti</p>
  <p time="351720" is_ac="true">next hello</p>
  <p time="354240" is_ac="true">thank you and look once I put my jacket</p>
  <p time="357240" is_ac="true">on the spaghetti arrived so let's take a</p>
  <p time="359639" is_ac="true">quick look now I would wager that anyone</p>
  <p time="363360" is_ac="true">in the Western Hemisphere and Europe</p>
  <p time="365280" is_ac="true">maybe even most people in the world have</p>
  <p time="367919" is_ac="true">had spaghetti at some point but when you</p>
  <p time="370259" is_ac="true">think spaghetti you usually think of</p>
  <p time="371580" is_ac="true">like a red spaghetti right and if we</p>
  <p time="373740" is_ac="true">indeed were able to go to carbon that's</p>
  <p time="375900" is_ac="true">probably what we would have gotten but</p>
  <p time="377460" is_ac="true">the server really hyped up this</p>
  <p time="380039" is_ac="true">spaghetti here at this place this is</p>
  <p time="382319" is_ac="true">more of a white spaghetti using ramp</p>
  <p time="384539" is_ac="true">which is kind of like leaks reviews say</p>
  <p time="386580" is_ac="true">that this spaghetti is out of this world</p>
  <p time="388259" is_ac="true">and what's interesting is this whole</p>
  <p time="390240" is_ac="true">thing is completely vegetarian not sure</p>
  <p time="392759" is_ac="true">if it's vegan but I believe it is meat</p>
  <p time="395160" is_ac="true">free all right let's give it a try</p>
  <p time="398539" is_ac="true">I've never been the best spaghetti</p>
  <p time="401100" is_ac="true">twirler so don't judge me if I kind of</p>
  <p time="403800" is_ac="true">go to town on this Asian noodle Style</p>
  <p time="413840" is_ac="true">oh wow let's see more of this before it</p>
  <p time="416580" is_ac="true">gets cold</p>
  <p time="425120" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="428720" is_ac="true">honestly I gotta say maybe I'm just not</p>
  <p time="431220" is_ac="true">in the know I've never been to Italy</p>
  <p time="432960" is_ac="true">I've only had Italian food in the</p>
  <p time="434880" is_ac="true">Western Hemisphere but I don't think</p>
  <p time="437160" is_ac="true">I've ever had a pasta dish like this in</p>
  <p time="438840" is_ac="true">my whole life so I will admit that when</p>
  <p time="441120" is_ac="true">I looked at it when I first got it I</p>
  <p time="443759" is_ac="true">didn't necessarily think too much of it</p>
  <p time="445680" is_ac="true">you know it kind of looks like a bunch</p>
  <p time="446880" is_ac="true">of plain noodles there's no Meats it's</p>
  <p time="449580" is_ac="true">just leeks and some bread crumbs on top</p>
  <p time="451620" is_ac="true">but actually let me try to find some</p>
  <p time="453539" is_ac="true">better lighting there is a decent amount</p>
  <p time="455580" is_ac="true">of sauce on the bottom as you can see</p>
  <p time="457440" is_ac="true">there is a decent amount of sauce and</p>
  <p time="459180" is_ac="true">the sauce was actually already evenly</p>
  <p time="461819" is_ac="true">coating all the noodles so the noodles</p>
  <p time="464520" is_ac="true">were actually covered in sauce but it</p>
  <p time="466380" is_ac="true">was so subtle that you couldn't really</p>
  <p time="468240" is_ac="true">see it like it wasn't like your typical</p>
  <p time="469860" is_ac="true">Italian restaurant like your fettuccine</p>
  <p time="471780" is_ac="true">alfredo just basically doused in like</p>
  <p time="473699" is_ac="true">cream and butter it was like really</p>
  <p time="476280" is_ac="true">gently covering every single pasta every</p>
  <p time="479280" is_ac="true">single Noodle and the ramp which the</p>
  <p time="481740" is_ac="true">server said is kind of like leaks he</p>
  <p time="483539" is_ac="true">said these are in season which is why</p>
  <p time="485400" is_ac="true">they had these on the menu right now</p>
  <p time="487020" is_ac="true">really really great great leek flavor it</p>
  <p time="490319" is_ac="true">really just tastes like a very leek dish</p>
  <p time="492960" is_ac="true">the joke I made earlier I'm gonna</p>
  <p time="494460" is_ac="true">recycle it it really ramped up the</p>
  <p time="496199" is_ac="true">spaghetti leeks the garlic butter sauce</p>
  <p time="498900" is_ac="true">over the noodles excellent these bread</p>
  <p time="501840" is_ac="true">crumbs they just add like a completely</p>
  <p time="504300" is_ac="true">different dimension really really add</p>
  <p time="506220" is_ac="true">like that necessary crunch so that you</p>
  <p time="508560" is_ac="true">don't feel like you're just eating like</p>
  <p time="509879" is_ac="true">some buttered plain noodles no matter</p>
  <p time="511860" is_ac="true">how good nobody wants to just only eat a</p>
  <p time="513899" is_ac="true">plate of noodles but the bread crumbs</p>
  <p time="515820" is_ac="true">just really add like a whole another</p>
  <p time="517860" is_ac="true">dimension texture wise I know it might</p>
  <p time="520080" is_ac="true">be hard to believe because you know I</p>
  <p time="521880" is_ac="true">know my camera is not really showing it</p>
  <p time="523560" is_ac="true">properly I know like it doesn't really</p>
  <p time="525360" is_ac="true">look all that great based on the</p>
  <p time="527399" is_ac="true">lighting and based on my camera but</p>
  <p time="529200" is_ac="true">you're gonna have to take my word for it</p>
  <p time="530700" is_ac="true">it tastes excellent</p>
  <p time="534420" is_ac="true">and this Pasta Too perfectly Al Dente</p>
  <p time="537300" is_ac="true">like they just hit like the perfect</p>
  <p time="538620" is_ac="true">doneness level for the pasta</p>
  <p time="544100" is_ac="true">it's got that perfect chew that perfect</p>
  <p time="547019" is_ac="true">texture the only thing is for the</p>

  <p time="551940" is_ac="true">York City I'm not sure if this is a</p>

  <p time="558300" is_ac="true">quite have that heterogeneity it kind of</p>
  <p time="561180" is_ac="true">looks like it's you know dry pasta</p>

  <p time="564839" is_ac="true">off the flavors are just it incredible</p>
  <p time="567720" is_ac="true">who knew that something that looks so</p>
  <p time="569760" is_ac="true">simple would just taste so complex and</p>
  <p time="572100" is_ac="true">so good like you're looking at spaghetti</p>
  <p time="574019" is_ac="true">and you know your first instinct might</p>
  <p time="576480" is_ac="true">be spaghetti come on I can make that at</p>
  <p time="578279" is_ac="true">home just pour some pre-made Ragu Sauce</p>
  <p time="580500" is_ac="true">on top of some noodles but trust me</p>
  <p time="582120" is_ac="true">you've never had spaghetti like this</p>
  <p time="591959" is_ac="true">just look I absolutely cleaned the plate</p>
  <p time="595080" is_ac="true">with this let's even mop up these</p>
  <p time="596700" is_ac="true">breadcrumbs I don't wait</p>
  <p time="599459" is_ac="true">um</p>
  <p time="600540" is_ac="true">moment too soon dessert has arrived now</p>
  <p time="603959" is_ac="true">there might have been not quite a</p>
  <p time="605760" is_ac="true">consensus on line for which of the main</p>
  <p time="608760" is_ac="true">courses were the best but for dessert</p>
  <p time="611040" is_ac="true">this olive oil cake was pretty much</p>
  <p time="612959" is_ac="true">unanimous let's see if I can contribute</p>
  <p time="615720" is_ac="true">to that unanimity</p>
  <p time="631380" is_ac="true">foreign</p>
  <p time="633260" is_ac="true">I mean the cake is good you know I'm not</p>
  <p time="635640" is_ac="true">gonna say it's not good it definitely</p>
  <p time="636959" is_ac="true">tastes like a solid cake after eating</p>
  <p time="639180" is_ac="true">that spaghetti I will say that the cake</p>
  <p time="641040" is_ac="true">was a little bit underwhelming maybe the</p>
  <p time="642839" is_ac="true">spaghetti was just so good my</p>
  <p time="644459" is_ac="true">expectations were too high for the cake</p>
  <p time="645899" is_ac="true">I would say the cake is a little bit dry</p>
  <p time="647880" is_ac="true">a little bit powdery not quite as moist</p>
  <p time="650940" is_ac="true">as I would like for a cake so let's try</p>
  <p time="653399" is_ac="true">mixing some of the ingredients I feel</p>
  <p time="655320" is_ac="true">like these are supposed to go together</p>
  <p time="664860" is_ac="true">hmm</p>
  <p time="667160" is_ac="true">oh oh that creme fraiche is really</p>
  <p time="669959" is_ac="true">really good</p>
  <p time="674399" is_ac="true">I almost feel like the creme fraiche is</p>
  <p time="676560" is_ac="true">really the star of the show I feel like</p>
  <p time="678660" is_ac="true">the cake is very like Bland and very dry</p>
  <p time="680700" is_ac="true">and a little dry a little Bland and I</p>
  <p time="682980" is_ac="true">feel like it's almost like a perfect</p>
  <p time="684240" is_ac="true">Blank Slate to eat this creme fresh with</p>
  <p time="686820" is_ac="true">eating the creme fresh on its own a</p>
  <p time="688740" is_ac="true">little bit too rich usually you would</p>
  <p time="690360" is_ac="true">think that the cake is the star and the</p>
  <p time="692279" is_ac="true">cream complements the cake I feel like</p>
  <p time="694019" is_ac="true">it's almost the opposite here the cream</p>
  <p time="695820" is_ac="true">is the star and the cake is just like</p>
  <p time="697920" is_ac="true">you know some cardboard they give you to</p>
  <p time="699779" is_ac="true">eat it with this is like a raisin</p>
  <p time="702000" is_ac="true">marmalade I think he said let's try this</p>
  <p time="708480" is_ac="true">um that's pretty nice and I don't</p>
  <p time="710640" is_ac="true">usually like raisins but that tastes</p>
  <p time="712440" is_ac="true">really really good it's almost like</p>
  <p time="713399" is_ac="true">eating candy it almost reminds me of</p>
  <p time="715320" is_ac="true">like a Jolly Rancher or Sour Patch Kids</p>
  <p time="718320" is_ac="true">with only the gummy and a little bit of</p>
  <p time="720000" is_ac="true">the sourness inside that's really tasty</p>
  <p time="721920" is_ac="true">let's see if we can get a perfect bite a</p>
  <p time="726000" is_ac="true">little bit of cake a little bit of creme</p>
  <p time="728640" is_ac="true">fraiche and some raisin marmalade this</p>
  <p time="733680" is_ac="true">looks like the perfect bite</p>
  <p time="739279" is_ac="true">wow oh wow let's take a second perfect</p>
  <p time="742560" is_ac="true">bite let's see if we can take a perfect</p>
  <p time="744660" is_ac="true">dirt bite</p>
  <p time="751740" is_ac="true">um</p>
  <p time="753420" is_ac="true">wow wow when you combine everything</p>
  <p time="756480" is_ac="true">together it's just perfect I started out</p>
  <p time="759000" is_ac="true">with the cake I was like the cake is</p>
  <p time="760560" is_ac="true">kind of dry then I went with the cream</p>
  <p time="762120" is_ac="true">the cream was good the reason marmalade</p>
  <p time="764399" is_ac="true">was good but then once you start</p>
  <p time="765720" is_ac="true">combining flavors it just elevates</p>
  <p time="768180" is_ac="true">everything I kind of take back what I</p>
  <p time="769800" is_ac="true">said about the cake you don't want the</p>
  <p time="771360" is_ac="true">cake to be too intense because you want</p>
  <p time="773519" is_ac="true">everything to work in harmony I totally</p>
