  <p time="51719" is_ac="true">is so good like if you ever tried this</p>
  <p time="53800" is_ac="true">one I highly recommend this is one that</p>
  <p time="55280" is_ac="true">I heard people would often recommend to</p>
  <p time="57039" is_ac="true">get here Tokyo station is a place that</p>
  <p time="58920" is_ac="true">you're probably going to be in a lot</p>
  <p time="60480" is_ac="true">because it's the central train station</p>
  <p time="62359" is_ac="true">here in Tokyo so while you're passing</p>
  <p time="64239" is_ac="true">through make sure to check it out if</p>

  <p time="73240" is_ac="true">something you need to</p>
  <p time="75040" is_ac="true">try the next morning I had to check out</p>
  <p time="77360" is_ac="true">the closest Cafe to of course enjoy a</p>
  <p time="79320" is_ac="true">hot cup of matcha no trip to Japan is</p>
  <p time="81439" is_ac="true">complete without one honestly you can</p>
  <p time="83159" is_ac="true">find this at most cafes but the real</p>
  <p time="84920" is_ac="true">treat was something sweet that is worth</p>
  <p time="86799" is_ac="true">penciling in your</p>
  <p time="88840" is_ac="true">schedule</p>
  <p time="90400" is_ac="true">okay so one of the things that you have</p>
  <p time="93960" is_ac="true">to try when you're in Japan are the</p>
  <p time="96200" is_ac="true">fluffy jiggly pancakes now if you're</p>
  <p time="99439" is_ac="true">vegan you're not really going to find</p>
  <p time="101040" is_ac="true">them anywhere except for one place and</p>
  <p time="103600" is_ac="true">that is where I am right now and this is</p>
  <p time="105240" is_ac="true">called an Sophia in the jinza area they</p>
  <p time="107920" is_ac="true">have two locations actually they have</p>
  <p time="110520" is_ac="true">the vegan pancakes here you have to</p>
  <p time="112399" is_ac="true">reserve them though because they just</p>
  <p time="114759" is_ac="true">sell out if you don't so if you go on</p>
  <p time="116520" is_ac="true">the website you can choose your table</p>
  <p time="118000" is_ac="true">you have to make a reservation for the</p>
  <p time="119280" is_ac="true">restaurant because cuz it books up</p>
  <p time="120799" is_ac="true">really quickly they serve it to you with</p>
  <p time="123320" is_ac="true">these ice creams and Berry syrups and</p>
  <p time="125759" is_ac="true">everything and these beautiful fruit and</p>
  <p time="127320" is_ac="true">they give you a salad first to start off</p>
  <p time="128920" is_ac="true">so you can have your Savory first before</p>
  <p time="130479" is_ac="true">enjoying the suite so let's get to this</p>
  <p time="133879" is_ac="true">because I have wanted this forever it</p>
  <p time="136720" is_ac="true">comes with cream and ice cream</p>
  <p time="139959" is_ac="true">and okay I'm putting a little bit of</p>
  <p time="144640" is_ac="true">everything M these are super fluffy I</p>
  <p time="148319" is_ac="true">will say they don't jiggle like the</p>
  <p time="150560" is_ac="true">original ones because you get that from</p>
  <p time="153319" is_ac="true">usually egg white and Etc so I think</p>
  <p time="155680" is_ac="true">these are really good for a vegan option</p>
  <p time="158080" is_ac="true">obviously the ingredients have to be</p>
  <p time="159599" is_ac="true">different but I highly appreciate the</p>
  <p time="161920" is_ac="true">fluffiness of the pancake I mean just</p>
  <p time="163920" is_ac="true">look at this you guys you have to see it</p>
  <p time="165480" is_ac="true">they have a bunch of other desserts and</p>
  <p time="166920" is_ac="true">other Savory items on their menu as well</p>
  <p time="168840" is_ac="true">if you can reserve these and then order</p>
  <p time="170680" is_ac="true">a bunch of other things that's great so</p>
  <p time="172319" is_ac="true">make sure you give this place a try when</p>
  <p time="174120" is_ac="true">you come to Tokyo but I had to admit one</p>
  <p time="176800" is_ac="true">of my favorite places in Tokyo was</p>
  <p time="178560" is_ac="true">actually a convenience store Lawson is a</p>
  <p time="180599" is_ac="true">must try in Tokyo as there's 11,000</p>
  <p time="182840" is_ac="true">across Japan I was addicted to the</p>
  <p time="184799" is_ac="true">seaweed Oni gidis and Yuba stuff with</p>
  <p time="186959" is_ac="true">rice they're known for having high</p>
  <p time="188680" is_ac="true">quality foods at affordable prices and</p>
  <p time="190599" is_ac="true">don't worry if you don't know Japanese</p>
  <p time="192360" is_ac="true">just use Google Translate they had so</p>
  <p time="194120" is_ac="true">many vegan snacks to choose from I wish</p>
  <p time="195959" is_ac="true">there was one in La there's microwaves</p>
  <p time="197680" is_ac="true">to heat up your food if needed basic</p>
  <p time="199319" is_ac="true">toiletries and more so just make sure to</p>

  <p time="410039" is_ac="true">to see first in terms of the vegan food</p>
  <p time="411720" is_ac="true">scene there is a lot of plant-based</p>
  <p time="413440" is_ac="true">options here you can tell that the</p>
  <p time="415599" is_ac="true">tourism Board of Tokyo is really like</p>
  <p time="418199" is_ac="true">promoting a plant-based diet we're</p>
  <p time="419919" is_ac="true">promoting where to get vegan food so you</p>
  <p time="422639" is_ac="true">just kind of you have to look up on</p>

  <p time="447680" is_ac="true">need that for the metro and they</p>
  <p time="449680" is_ac="true">actually use cashier a lot so don't</p>
  <p time="452639" is_ac="true">depend on your credit card I made that</p>
  <p time="454000" is_ac="true">mistake either way Tokyo is definitely a</p>
