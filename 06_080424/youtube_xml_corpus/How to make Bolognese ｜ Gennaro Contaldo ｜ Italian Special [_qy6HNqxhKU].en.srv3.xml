Gennaro’s bolognese, this is one hell of a recipe that is worth every minute of love, care, and attention. Give it a go, you won’t be disappointed! &#10;&#10;Gennaro in Italy&#10;Over the coming months we will be posting a series of Gennaro’s recipes from Italy, some of which you, the audience, have specifically asked for and others are Gennaro doing what the Italians do best – sourcing good ingredients and making simple, bold dishes with little effort and time involved. &#10;&#10;Rather than cut these videos right down, we have left them a little longer and kept them relaxed. We think watching Gennaro in Italy is a glorious thing, and Gennaro does such a great job at being both inspiring and entertaining. So sit back and enjoy these as they roll out – we would love to know what you think.&#10;&#10;Thanks for subscribing! : https://www.youtube.com/user/jamieoliver?sub_confirmation=1&#10;&#10;Links from the video:&#10;&#10;How to make Gnocchi | Gennaro Contaldo | Italian Special&#10;https://jamieol.com/GennaroGnocchi&#10;&#10;Tuna Pasta | Gennaro Contaldo | Italian Special&#10;https://jamieol.com/GennaroTunaPasta&#10;&#10;&#10;For more information on any Jamie Oliver products featured on the channel click here: &#10;http://www.jamieoliver.com/shop/homeware/&#10;&#10;For more nutrition info, click here: http://jamieol.com/Nutrition&#10;&#10;&#10;x" fulltitle="How to make Bolognese | Gennaro Contaldo | Italian Special" like_count="68314" location="na" playlist_title="na" release_date="na" upload_date="20191110" repost_count="na" tags="jamie; oliver; cooking; food; cook; recipe; tube; chef; foodtube; jamieoliver; meat; bolagnese; spaghetti; pasta; ragu; italian; italy; gennaro; gennaro contaldo; two greedy italians; piedmont; carrots; onions; herbs; olive oil; " title="How to make Bolognese | Gennaro Contaldo | Italian Special" uploader="Jamie Oliver" view_count="4790631" webpage_url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qy6HNqxhKU" autocaption="false">
  <p time="180" is_ac="false">Hi lovely people, I am in Italy in Piedmont
 and I'm gonna make a fantastic</p>
  <p time="6080" is_ac="false">Tagliatelle Bolognese. Yes, the original 
one. This is the way I love it. I have so many</p>
  <p time="12900" is_ac="false">different versions of making it this is
the way I make it. Now I've got my sofrito,</p>
  <p time="18470" is_ac="false">celery, carrot, onions, and pancetta. I soften
it up a little bit and now I have two</p>
  <p time="25439" is_ac="false">different mincemeat. One it minced veal,
you can see it's very very fine, just put</p>
  <p time="31710" is_ac="false">it inside
Oh yes, and the other one is minced pork</p>
  <p time="38190" is_ac="false">which is a little bit thicker. Inside here I put</p>
  <p time="41989" is_ac="false">one carrot, one onion and one stalk of celery</p>
  <p time="46980" is_ac="false">and is about 100 grams of pancetta.</p>
  <p time="51240" is_ac="false">Everything goes in. Now you see all the meat,
start to break the meat. It is so</p>
  <p time="59280" is_ac="false">important that you seal the meat
properly because some of the meat has just got</p>
  <p time="64080" is_ac="false">so much water inside you almost boil it
before you start to fry it. Here you</p>
  <p time="70680" is_ac="false">seal it you will get rid of all the water.
Right the meat is sealed now I need to</p>
  <p time="77220" is_ac="false">put a bit of wine, I like a nice red with
mine just put it inside</p>
  <p time="86630" is_ac="false">keep stirring it I have put the wine inside
now and now I put some tomato.</p>
  <p time="93080" is_ac="false">For proper Bolognese you use concentrate of
tomato with a little bit of water or</p>
  <p time="99710" is_ac="false">stock inside, which this is what I've done here, to become a little bit fine just put</p>
  <p time="105710" is_ac="false">it inside</p>
  <p time="108820" is_ac="false">Yeah! I'm gonna use the rest of the stock
and let it cook a little bit. Then you</p>
  <p time="118570" is_ac="false">use a stock. Very very important that you
use stock.</p>
  <p time="127369" is_ac="false">I carry on cooking. Use stock any stock.
Remember this is meat if you want to use</p>
  <p time="134900" is_ac="false">chicken stock fantastic
which is good or vegetable stock, both</p>
  <p time="139700" is_ac="false">ways working. Little bit more stock inside the
rest of the concentrated tomato</p>
  <p time="150900" is_ac="false">that I diluted just earlier on.</p>
  <p time="166200" is_ac="false">Let's put the lid on the gas is
turned down slowly slowly slowly.</p>
  <p time="173160" is_ac="false">Let's come back in about an hours time. But now and again I'll come back to stir it.</p>
  <p time="182040" is_ac="false">The sun is so nice we've go up an hour so let's sit in
the Sun contemplating how I am gonna serve it.</p>
  <p time="191400" is_ac="false">I can imagine it's gonna be so good.
This is looking good. Wow the Sun was</p>
  <p time="199269" is_ac="false">good! It revived me! Look at that! Come
inside! Just come and have a look.</p>
  <p time="204370" is_ac="false">Look this is about an hour it has become like a cream.
 Right, let's do it now. The pasta is</p>
  <p time="214180" is_ac="false">ready, the ragu is ready. Just a
little pan on top here, just little bit inside the pan.</p>
  <p time="225520" is_ac="false">Little bit of the of pasta water.</p>
  <p time="233300" is_ac="false">Let's use this one. We'll put the pasta on top here. 
Look at this!</p>
  <p time="243520" is_ac="false">Oh my my! This is what I'm talking about.</p>
  <p time="248360" is_ac="false">A proper bolognese. I think it's ready.
I put it all back in the pan, the reason</p>
  <p time="258410" is_ac="false">why because I want the pasta to grab
the lovely flavour of the sofrito, of</p>
  <p time="263870" is_ac="false">the pancetta, of the beef, so
everything is combined and all together</p>
  <p time="268220" is_ac="false">and also it sticks on it, and when it
sticks on it stays, and when you wrap</p>
  <p time="273230" is_ac="false">the fork inside, an explosion of flavour.
I keep saying all the time, because it is!</p>
  <p time="280760" is_ac="false">Turn everything off. Oh my. Yes. Go on until it's all in.
I can tell you it smells fantastic.</p>
  <p time="300260" is_ac="false">Just a little more drop of water. Pasta water is so important.</p>
  <p time="310380" is_ac="false">Ahhhh. Look at this!</p>
  <p time="321740" is_ac="false">A nice grating of Parmasean.</p>
  <p time="326360" is_ac="false">Oh oh! I love it!</p>
  <p time="338660" is_ac="false">And this is the proper Ragu Bolognese. So
easy to make it. So tasty.</p>
  <p time="347919" is_ac="false">You can see now the Sun is coming down
slowly slowly slowly, it's time for me to</p>
  <p time="354910" is_ac="false">go to eat. Actually it's time for me to eat
this Bolognese.</p>
  <p time="358449" is_ac="false">Tagliatelle Bolognese. Can I? No, I have to go in. Bless you!! Oh my my!</p>
