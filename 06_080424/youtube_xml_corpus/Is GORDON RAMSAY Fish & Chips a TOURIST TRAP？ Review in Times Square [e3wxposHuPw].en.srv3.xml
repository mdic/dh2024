With Gordon Ramsay's 17 Michelin stars, he is indisputably the best chef in England and the best chef in the United Kingdom. His flagship restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London, has held three Michelin stars for more than 20 years. There is no question he is one of the best chefs in the world when it comes to haute cuisine and Western fine dining.&#10;&#10;However, what is interesting about Gordon Ramsay is he has made the leap beyond being renowned in fine dining. Due to his TV shows and his fiery and entertaining personality, he is now a celebrity chef and perhaps the most famous chef in the world. Due to his fame amongst the masses, he has started opening a chain of Gordon Ramsay fast food and Gordon Ramsay fast casual restaurants. While some of his past restaurants, such as Gordon Ramsay Steak and Gordon Ramsay Pub &amp; Grill, were more casual but were still sit-down restaurants, Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips specializes in takeout and does not have wait staff.&#10;&#10;While this chain already has had three locations, namely Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips Las Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips Orlando, and Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips Washington DC, the latest iteration of it is Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips New York City branch. Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips in Times Square is smack dab in a tourist center, so it begs the question. Is Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips good? Or is Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips a tourist trap?&#10;&#10;Beyond whether or not Gordon Ramsay's fish and chips recipe is good, or whether or not Gordon can make a great British fish and chips, or a British pub style fish and chips, Gordon Ramsay's immense fame has led to many viewing him as THE source of great cooking. Because of that, any restaurant that Gordon Ramsay opens will surely see a flood of traffic just because of his name. Because of that, one big question will be in general: Is Gordon Ramsay overrated? Is Gordon Ramsay just a celebrity chef? Or is Gordon Ramsay legit? And is Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips a tourist trap?&#10;&#10;I hope you enjoy the video and the food vlog! I always have fun reviewing great restaurants in New York City. This was the first time I got to review some of the best food in Times Square NYC. I also get to find out if Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips is among the best English food in NYC and the best British food in NYC.&#10;&#10;Like and Subscribe!&#10;&#10;Restaurant Deets:&#10;Gordon Ramsay Fish &amp; Chips&#10;1500 Broadway Suite 105, New York, NY 10036" fulltitle="Is GORDON RAMSAY Fish &amp; Chips a TOURIST TRAP?

  <p time="9300" is_ac="true">channel we've covered some local</p>
  <p time="10440" is_ac="true">neighborhood spots but the reason we're</p>
  <p time="12240" is_ac="true">in Times Square is because word just got</p>
  <p time="14759" is_ac="true">out that just yesterday Gordon Ramsay</p>
  <p time="17340" is_ac="true">opened a restaurant here in Times Square</p>
  <p time="19199" is_ac="true">Gordon Ramsay fish and chips now if you</p>
  <p time="21779" is_ac="true">followed my channel you know I'm a bit</p>
  <p time="23640" is_ac="true">of a Gordon Ramsay fan a few months ago</p>
  <p time="25740" is_ac="true">I went to his Pub and Grill Restaurant</p>
  <p time="27300" is_ac="true">in Atlantic City and I had a great time</p>
  <p time="29699" is_ac="true">the food was great the service was great</p>
  <p time="31920" is_ac="true">it was just a great time in general</p>
  <p time="33480" is_ac="true">however the one thing that was not great</p>
  <p time="35399" is_ac="true">was the fish and chips and that was</p>
  <p time="37440" is_ac="true">surprising to me considering that he's a</p>
  <p time="39239" is_ac="true">British chef that's why I'm surprised</p>
  <p time="41160" is_ac="true">that the restaurant he opened here in</p>
  <p time="42960" is_ac="true">New York is not a fine dining restaurant</p>
  <p time="44820" is_ac="true">or even a sit-down restaurant he opened</p>
  <p time="47579" is_ac="true">what seems to be a fast casual Fish and</p>
  <p time="49680" is_ac="true">Chips Restaurant now I love Gordon</p>
  <p time="51480" is_ac="true">Ramsay as much as the next guy but</p>
  <p time="53280" is_ac="true">English Chef selling fish and chips in</p>
  <p time="55559" is_ac="true">Times Square to me that just screams</p>
  <p time="57719" is_ac="true">tourist trap all over it however it's</p>
  <p time="59640" is_ac="true">early but so far reviews are actually</p>
  <p time="61620" is_ac="true">pretty good so I decided to head over</p>
  <p time="63480" is_ac="true">for part two of is Gordon Ramsay</p>
  <p time="65880" is_ac="true">overrated this time we're gonna try his</p>
  <p time="67740" is_ac="true">fast casual restaurant and we're gonna</p>
  <p time="69240" is_ac="true">see if he's overrated or if he's legit</p>

  <p time="87080" is_ac="true">all right here we are at Gordon Ramsay</p>
  <p time="89759" is_ac="true">fish and chips here in Times Square uh</p>
  <p time="91979" is_ac="true">you know I kind of expected for a</p>
  <p time="93600" is_ac="true">celebrity chef of his Fame I kind of</p>
  <p time="95700" is_ac="true">expected that there would be a bit of a</p>
  <p time="97020" is_ac="true">line outside this restaurant but it</p>
  <p time="98700" is_ac="true">really just opened a day or so ago so I</p>
  <p time="100560" is_ac="true">guess word might not have gotten out</p>
  <p time="101759" is_ac="true">about it opening yet we can see by the</p>
  <p time="103740" is_ac="true">size of the Porsche above that Chef</p>
  <p time="105180" is_ac="true">Ramsay has no shortage of ego as well of</p>
  <p time="107400" is_ac="true">course of the fact that the restaurant</p>
  <p time="108420" is_ac="true">is called Gordon Ramsay fish and chips</p>
  <p time="110280" is_ac="true">honestly there are a few things that say</p>
  <p time="112320" is_ac="true">British food like fish and chips so</p>
  <p time="113939" is_ac="true">whether or not he makes a good fish and</p>
  <p time="115439" is_ac="true">chips will say a lot about whether or</p>
  <p time="117180" is_ac="true">not he's overrated or if he's legit so</p>
  <p time="119280" is_ac="true">let's go check him out</p>

  <p time="128539" is_ac="true">as you can see unlike some of his other</p>
  <p time="130979" is_ac="true">restaurants this restaurant is not</p>
  <p time="132540" is_ac="true">really a sit-down restaurant it's really</p>
  <p time="134340" is_ac="true">more a fast casual or a fast food</p>
  <p time="136140" is_ac="true">restaurant and to be honest that kind of</p>
  <p time="138180" is_ac="true">makes sense because fish and chips in</p>
  <p time="139620" is_ac="true">the UK is really more like a fast food</p>
  <p time="141840" is_ac="true">it's really more like a takeaway food</p>
  <p time="143340" is_ac="true">you know he's really playing up the</p>
  <p time="145260" is_ac="true">British angle I mean this is pretty much</p>

  <p time="159120" is_ac="true">you're not aware naan is like an Indian</p>
  <p time="160680" is_ac="true">flatbread so they have these sandwiches</p>
  <p time="162720" is_ac="true">that are wrapped in naan I find that</p>
  <p time="164700" is_ac="true">kind of interesting so we're gonna try</p>
  <p time="166440" is_ac="true">it it doesn't really sound very</p>
  <p time="167640" is_ac="true">efficient chips like but hey maybe it's</p>
  <p time="169379" is_ac="true">good but we also got in the meanwhile a</p>
  <p time="172319" is_ac="true">stiffy a sticky toffee pudding Shake now</p>

  <p time="226620" is_ac="true">with me but it really has a nice fried</p>
  <p time="228720" is_ac="true">batter smell it already looks much</p>
  <p time="231299" is_ac="true">better than the fish and chips I had at</p>
  <p time="232739" is_ac="true">this restaurant in Atlantic City uh that</p>
  <p time="234659" is_ac="true">one was I will be honest a little bit</p>
  <p time="236340" is_ac="true">disappointing but this already looks</p>
  <p time="238140" is_ac="true">great I mean honestly takeout is the</p>
  <p time="240060" is_ac="true">perfect format for fish and chips it's</p>
  <p time="242099" is_ac="true">not really a sit down food so fast food</p>
  <p time="244680" is_ac="true">fish and chips really is the way to go</p>
  <p time="246299" is_ac="true">but this just looks beautifully breaded</p>
  <p time="248519" is_ac="true">I kind of like that they impaled this</p>
  <p time="250379" is_ac="true">lemon on it for presentation so yeah</p>
  <p time="252599" is_ac="true">this is looking and smelling pretty good</p>
  <p time="255299" is_ac="true">and this is the chicken witch sandwich</p>
  <p time="257160" is_ac="true">between naan bread and this is really</p>
  <p time="259919" is_ac="true">interesting uh basically it looks like a</p>
  <p time="262139" is_ac="true">chicken taco but just with Indian bread</p>
  <p time="264120" is_ac="true">instead of tortilla I'm starving guys</p>
  <p time="265979" is_ac="true">that's enough talk let's dig in all</p>
  <p time="268139" is_ac="true">right guys let's dig in</p>
  <p time="270740" is_ac="true">whoa whoa guys just picking them up the</p>
  <p time="274320" is_ac="true">texture is not at all what I expected</p>
  <p time="276240" is_ac="true">you really when I pick up fried food I</p>
  <p time="278160" is_ac="true">almost expect them to feel kind of dense</p>
  <p time="280020" is_ac="true">because I don't know that friedness</p>
  <p time="281639" is_ac="true">makes them really crispy and hard but</p>
  <p time="283440" is_ac="true">this feels like super light I don't know</p>
  <p time="286199" is_ac="true">it almost feels like tempura batter kind</p>
  <p time="288540" is_ac="true">of and even though as you can see by my</p>
  <p time="290580" is_ac="true">fingers it's oily somehow it doesn't</p>
  <p time="292860" is_ac="true">feel super heavy to the touch I don't</p>
  <p time="295080" is_ac="true">know how to explain it tempura really is</p>
  <p time="297000" is_ac="true">the best way all right let's try one</p>
  <p time="298740" is_ac="true">bite without sauce</p>
  <p time="305400" is_ac="true">oh</p>
  <p time="308460" is_ac="true">it's a little hot guys</p>
  <p time="315139" is_ac="true">oh whoa honestly guys I came in here</p>
  <p time="318000" is_ac="true">totally ready to like dunk on this place</p>
  <p time="320340" is_ac="true">and say it's overrated say it's in Times</p>
  <p time="322560" is_ac="true">Square so it's a tourist trap especially</p>
  <p time="324360" is_ac="true">because I went to Atlantic City and the</p>
  <p time="326100" is_ac="true">Fish and Chips I had in Atlantic City at</p>

  <p time="333360" is_ac="true">time I've had fish and chips that kind</p>
  <p time="335280" is_ac="true">of tasted like fish and chips I had in</p>
  <p time="336840" is_ac="true">the UK outside of the UK of course let</p>
  <p time="339180" is_ac="true">me hold it up closer hopefully you can</p>
  <p time="341039" is_ac="true">see that it's fried perfectly perfect</p>
  <p time="343199" is_ac="true">golden brown but it's not fried greasy</p>
  <p time="346020" is_ac="true">it's not overly oily or heavy it's not</p>
  <p time="348720" is_ac="true">like you're just eating a bunch of</p>
  <p time="349800" is_ac="true">crunchy bread crumbs it really does</p>
  <p time="351660" is_ac="true">resemble tempura more than normal deep</p>
  <p time="354120" is_ac="true">frying and just look at the inside of</p>
  <p time="355800" is_ac="true">the fish look at how that fish flakes</p>
  <p time="358080" is_ac="true">apart like that that is fresh Cod</p>
  <p time="359940" is_ac="true">perfectly fried perfect temperature for</p>
  <p time="362400" is_ac="true">it to get flaky like that</p>
  <p time="364979" is_ac="true">hmm it's really good guys really good</p>
  <p time="367979" is_ac="true">let's try it with one of the sauces</p>
  <p time="370020" is_ac="true">let's try it with the tartar sauce which</p>
  <p time="372240" is_ac="true">to be honest was pretty good at his</p>
  <p time="373919" is_ac="true">restaurant in Atlantic City dunk</p>

  <p time="389940" is_ac="true">was only okay but the tartar sauce was</p>
  <p time="393000" is_ac="true">fire this tartar sauce also fire I would</p>
  <p time="396180" is_ac="true">say it's a little less Rich than the</p>
  <p time="397740" is_ac="true">restaurant in Atlantic City but it's</p>
  <p time="399479" is_ac="true">good I mean it works well for a fast</p>
  <p time="401100" is_ac="true">food takeout fish and chips very very</p>
  <p time="402840" is_ac="true">good compliments the fish really well</p>
  <p time="404580" is_ac="true">now I really want to try this sauce this</p>

  <p time="427139" is_ac="true">wow I couldn't really tell that Gordon</p>
  <p time="430139" is_ac="true">really likes Indian food because that</p>
  <p time="431759" is_ac="true">really has like a spice flavor and I</p>
  <p time="433860" is_ac="true">don't mean like it's spicy because it's</p>
  <p time="435300" is_ac="true">really not hot at all but it really</p>
  <p time="436919" is_ac="true">tastes like a myriad of Curry spices you</p>
  <p time="439919" is_ac="true">taste that turmeric you taste that gram</p>
  <p time="442080" is_ac="true">Masala I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan so I've</p>
  <p time="444060" is_ac="true">seen some of his TV shows where he's</p>
  <p time="445740" is_ac="true">traveled the world and he always seems</p>
  <p time="447479" is_ac="true">to have a lot of fun in India so it's</p>
  <p time="449340" is_ac="true">interesting that he made like an Indian</p>
  <p time="451139" is_ac="true">style sauce but honestly guys</p>
  <p time="456900" is_ac="true">cool but honestly guys it kind of pairs</p>
  <p time="459840" is_ac="true">perfectly because the fish is kind of</p>
  <p time="461460" is_ac="true">more mild it's kind of more bland not</p>
  <p time="463319" is_ac="true">Bland in like a bad way but it doesn't</p>
  <p time="465300" is_ac="true">really have strong intense flavors but</p>
  <p time="467940" is_ac="true">it's Cod it's not like salmon it's</p>
  <p time="469560" is_ac="true">really like a blank slate fish it's not</p>
  <p time="471780" is_ac="true">like salmon or tuna where it has like a</p>
  <p time="473940" is_ac="true">strong flavor Cod is kind of like</p>
  <p time="475620" is_ac="true">chicken but in the ocean so it looks</p>
  <p time="477479" is_ac="true">like a clean slate and to pair it with</p>
  <p time="479580" is_ac="true">like some strong curry flavor</p>

  <p time="541560" is_ac="true">reviews before I came and people said</p>
  <p time="543300" is_ac="true">that the fish was good but they said</p>
  <p time="544680" is_ac="true">that the fries were not that good The</p>
  <p time="546240" is_ac="true">Washington Post even called them airport</p>
  <p time="547980" is_ac="true">fries I don't know I mean maybe they</p>
  <p time="550440" is_ac="true">heard the feedback and they improved</p>
  <p time="551820" is_ac="true">them</p>
  <p time="553580" is_ac="true">I mean I think these are pretty good</p>
  <p time="556279" is_ac="true">I think they're fried in peanut oil</p>
  <p time="558600" is_ac="true">they're not as good as Five Guys fries</p>
  <p time="560820" is_ac="true">Five Guys fries are my favorite then</p>
  <p time="563100" is_ac="true">Chick-fil-A but they kind of taste like</p>
  <p time="565140" is_ac="true">Five Guys fries a little bit I think</p>
  <p time="566940" is_ac="true">these are great</p>
  <p time="568940" is_ac="true">hmm let's do this though let's dip them</p>
  <p time="572279" is_ac="true">in the sauce</p>
  <p time="574380" is_ac="true">all right Ranch first</p>
  <p time="581700" is_ac="true">okay it doesn't really work with the</p>
  <p time="582899" is_ac="true">ranch to be honest the ranch is a little</p>
  <p time="584700" is_ac="true">bit too strong a little bit too sweet so</p>
  <p time="587279" is_ac="true">I would not recommend dipping them in</p>
  <p time="588779" is_ac="true">ranch</p>
  <p time="590100" is_ac="true">it doesn't really work but let's try the</p>
  <p time="591779" is_ac="true">mango curry sauce</p>
  <p time="595830" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="598260" is_ac="true">okay I think the sauces are more</p>
  <p time="599880" is_ac="true">designed for the fish don't dip the</p>
  <p time="601680" is_ac="true">fries or the chips don't dip the chips</p>
  <p time="603959" is_ac="true">in any of the sauces but they taste</p>
  <p time="607620" is_ac="true">great on their own anyways we have one</p>
  <p time="609240" is_ac="true">more item that I want to try now this is</p>
  <p time="611459" is_ac="true">what they call a chicken witch and it's</p>
  <p time="613140" is_ac="true">fried chicken sandwich between naan</p>
  <p time="615120" is_ac="true">Indian flatbread so guys</p>
  <p time="617839" is_ac="true">let's give it a try</p>
  <p time="626480" is_ac="true">okay so the Nam sandwich isn't my</p>
  <p time="629700" is_ac="true">favorite to be honest I don't know if I</p>
  <p time="631200" is_ac="true">let it sit too long because I guess it</p>
  <p time="632880" is_ac="true">is a little bit cold but um I don't know</p>
  <p time="635040" is_ac="true">to me it just doesn't really work I feel</p>
  <p time="636779" is_ac="true">like it kind of tastes more like a gyro</p>
  <p time="638279" is_ac="true">than it does like Indian food this</p>
  <p time="640320" is_ac="true">vegetable at the bottom is kind of like</p>
  <p time="641640" is_ac="true">coleslaw I don't know I mean it's very</p>
  <p time="644040" is_ac="true">common to eat fried chicken and then to</p>
  <p time="645899" is_ac="true">eat coleslaw on the side combining them</p>
  <p time="648120" is_ac="true">together uh it doesn't really work for</p>
  <p time="649920" is_ac="true">me sorry Gordon I also feel like you</p>
  <p time="651839" is_ac="true">kind of have some competing textures</p>
  <p time="653220" is_ac="true">like I feel like the naan bread is very</p>
  <p time="655200" is_ac="true">soft but it doesn't really have like a</p>
  <p time="657300" is_ac="true">charred non-flavor it kind of tastes</p>
  <p time="659459" is_ac="true">more like pita bread and then you have</p>
  <p time="661019" is_ac="true">the cold coleslaw on the bottom paired</p>
  <p time="662820" is_ac="true">with some greasier chicken that's not</p>
  <p time="664560" is_ac="true">really seasoned that well and to be</p>
  <p time="666600" is_ac="true">honest um this isn't really my favorite</p>
  <p time="668100" is_ac="true">stick with the fish and chips after all</p>
  <p time="670680" is_ac="true">this place is called Gordon Ramsay fish</p>
  <p time="672600" is_ac="true">and chips it's now called Gordon Ramsay</p>

  <p time="710220" is_ac="true">Gordon Ramsay overrated now I will be</p>
  <p time="712380" is_ac="true">completely honest the non-sandwich was</p>

  <p time="716399" is_ac="true">wasn't great but this place specializes</p>
  <p time="718740" is_ac="true">in fish and chips so I should mostly</p>
