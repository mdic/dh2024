  <p time="11200" is_ac="false">Welcome to Naples.</p>
  <p time="37970" is_ac="false">Harry Kersh: Hey guys, it's Harry.</p>
  <p time="39220" is_ac="false">Claudia Romeo: And this is Claudia.</p>
  <p time="40430" is_ac="false">And today we're in Naples, Italy,</p>
  <p time="42190" is_ac="false">in the birthplace of pizza</p>
  <p time="43582" is_ac="false">to find out which one
has the best one in town.</p>
  <p time="46360" is_ac="false">Harry: So, there are over
3,000 pizzerias here in Naples,</p>
  <p time="48810" is_ac="false">and pizza is a huge part of the culture.</p>
  <p time="50750" is_ac="false">We've used TripAdvisor,
YouTube, social media</p>
  <p time="53430" is_ac="false">to narrow it down to a top four.</p>
  <p time="55620" is_ac="false">Claudia: We also spoke to a local expert</p>
  <p time="57510" is_ac="false">that has eaten hundreds
of pizzas in his life.</p>
  <p time="60410" is_ac="false">And he's gonna give us his take</p>
  <p time="62688" is_ac="false">on what a real Neapolitan pizza is.</p>
  <p time="66620" is_ac="false">Antonio Fucito: So, pizza from Neapolitan</p>
  <p time="68128" is_ac="false">is a kind of ritual.</p>
  <p time="69620" is_ac="false">We cannot wait to eat the next pizza.</p>
  <p time="72350" is_ac="false">And we just dream about
that thought all the time.</p>
  <p time="75480" is_ac="false">A typical, classic margherita is made with</p>
  <p time="77830" is_ac="false">tomato sauce, fior di
latte cheese, some basil,</p>
  <p time="81740" is_ac="false">and you can add also some pecorino,</p>
  <p time="83885" is_ac="false">if you like a more rich flavor.</p>
  <p time="87300" is_ac="false">Harry: Now, it's really warm.</p>
  <p time="88230" is_ac="false">It's really early, but I'm
excited to eat some pizza.</p>
  <p time="90250" is_ac="false">Should we go?</p>
  <p time="91083" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, let's go.</p>
  <p time="93050" is_ac="false">Our first stop is at Gino e Toto Sorbillo,</p>
  <p time="95720" is_ac="false">which is located in Naples'
historic city center.</p>
  <p time="102490" is_ac="false">Antonio: Sorbillo, maybe, is
the most social pizza place</p>
  <p time="105528" is_ac="false">in Italy and in the
world because the owner,</p>
  <p time="108420" is_ac="false">Gino Sorbillo, is very well
known around the globe.</p>
  <p time="111980" is_ac="false">He likes to experiment using</p>
  <p time="114300" is_ac="false">some biological flour</p>
  <p time="116650" is_ac="false">and try to push more in terms of ingredients</p>
  <p time="120810" is_ac="false">in terms of atmosphere
in the center of Napoli.</p>
  <p time="155180" is_ac="false">Claudia: We joined Gino
Sorbillo in his kitchen</p>
  <p time="157470" is_ac="false">to show us how he makes his version</p>
  <p time="159409" is_ac="false">of the perfect margherita pizza.</p>
  <p time="233800" is_ac="false">Harry: This is a Sorbillo pizza.</p>
  <p time="235250" is_ac="false">What's it look like to you, Claudia?</p>
  <p time="236710" is_ac="false">Claudia: Well, it looks incredible.</p>
  <p time="237943" is_ac="false">I mean, just like, look
at all the colors in here.</p>
  <p time="240910" is_ac="false">I love the fact that
the mozzarella is, like,</p>
  <p time="243010" is_ac="false">sprinkled all over,</p>
  <p time="244360" is_ac="false">and sort of, like, mixed
in with the tomato sauce.</p>
  <p time="249110" is_ac="false">Do you know about the trick that you</p>
  <p time="250458" is_ac="false">have to fold the tip?</p>
  <p time="252670" is_ac="false">Harry: Interesting, OK.</p>
  <p time="254230" is_ac="false">Claudia: I've never actually
believed in it, but,</p>
  <p time="258090" is_ac="false">this makes it look like...</p>
  <p time="259022" is_ac="false">oh, look at the juices coming out.</p>
  <p time="262320" is_ac="false">That's it.</p>
  <p time="263153" is_ac="false">Harry: Cheers!
Claudia: Cheers!</p>
  <p time="269890" is_ac="false">Just, like, biting into that basil leaf,</p>
  <p time="272603" is_ac="false">it's so refreshing.</p>
  <p time="274490" is_ac="false">I love how it's, like, all one flavor.</p>
  <p time="277870" is_ac="false">They all mix in together.
Like, so heavenly.</p>
  <p time="280357" is_ac="false">Harry: Yeah, they really do.</p>
  <p time="281285" is_ac="false">I got a lot of the tomato, that's, like,</p>
  <p time="283080" is_ac="false">that kind of acidity,</p>
  <p time="284110" is_ac="false">sweetness from the tomato
is really, really good.</p>
  <p time="286850" is_ac="false">Claudia: The pizza itself
is, like, building up,</p>
  <p time="289108" is_ac="false">like, from the actual crust to the tip.</p>
  <p time="291510" is_ac="false">So you find the crust,
it's, like, thicker,</p>
  <p time="294272" is_ac="false">and then, of course, there's this juice.</p>
  <p time="296270" is_ac="false">But it's still, like,
very soft on the inside,</p>
  <p time="299390" is_ac="false">crunchy on the outside, and
then when you reach the tip</p>
  <p time="302010" is_ac="false">it's just, like, all the
flavors coming together</p>
  <p time="306110" is_ac="false">and clicking at the same time.</p>
  <p time="307973" is_ac="false">And you just reach that, like, perfection.</p>
  <p time="318820" is_ac="false">Harry: Next, we head
to Starita, a pizzeria</p>
  <p time="321103" is_ac="false">which is run by four generations
of the Starita family,</p>
  <p time="323940" is_ac="false">who famously made pizza
for Pope John Paul II</p>
  <p time="326732" is_ac="false">in the year 2000.</p>
  <p time="330907" is_ac="false">Antonio: Starita is
another historic place.</p>
  <p time="332740" is_ac="false">It offers many, many
different kind of pizza.</p>
  <p time="335540" is_ac="false">Even the shapes, they have a horn pizza,</p>
  <p time="338440" is_ac="false">horn fried pizza, it's very nice to try.</p>
  <p time="341048" is_ac="false">And the owner, Don Antonio,
is a master of marinara.</p>
  <p time="433576" is_ac="false">Harry: It seems like there's
maybe a bit more cheese</p>
  <p time="435475" is_ac="false">than we had at Sorbillo.</p>
  <p time="436410" is_ac="false">It's, or at least it's kinda like,</p>
  <p time="438070" is_ac="false">it pulls a bit more.</p>
  <p time="439410" is_ac="false">The crust looks incredible.</p>
  <p time="440590" is_ac="false">The crust is a bit more, like,
pronounced on this pizza.</p>
  <p time="443850" is_ac="false">Claudia: I think this one
looks a bit more uniform,</p>
  <p time="445970" is_ac="false">like, all colors are
blend perfectly together.</p>
  <p time="449125" is_ac="false">The tomato sauce looks brighter,</p>
  <p time="451430" is_ac="false">just, like, looks slightly more red.</p>
  <p time="464298" is_ac="false">Wow.</p>
  <p time="465400" is_ac="false">That tomato sauce is really kicking in.</p>
  <p time="468130" is_ac="false">Harry: Mm-hmm, that hits you.</p>
  <p time="471440" is_ac="false">So, as we mentioned at the start,</p>
  <p time="473580" is_ac="false">like, this dough has got
such a nice color to it.</p>
  <p time="476160" is_ac="false">It's got that kinda, like,
leopard-spotting going on,</p>
  <p time="479110" is_ac="false">which, again, just like,
all of that is flavor</p>
  <p time="481280" is_ac="false">'cause that's just coming
straight from the oven,</p>
  <p time="482740" is_ac="false">straight from the wood going
straight onto the pizza.</p>
  <p time="485250" is_ac="false">So, maybe a little bit
more, like, chewy and dense</p>
  <p time="487210" is_ac="false">than the one we had before.</p>
  <p time="488699" is_ac="false">Claudia: The pizza
toppings themselves, like,</p>
  <p time="490240" is_ac="false">they're quite richer, I think.</p>
  <p time="492760" is_ac="false">Apart from the tomato,
like, the mozzarella</p>
  <p time="494153" is_ac="false">is just, like, more in volume,</p>
  <p time="496200" is_ac="false">so I think you need, like,
a stronger base to hold it,</p>
  <p time="499920" is_ac="false">and then also, did you
notice with this one</p>
  <p time="501830" is_ac="false">we didn't flip, we didn't flip the tip?</p>
  <p time="503910" is_ac="false">There was no need for it.</p>
  <p time="505230" is_ac="false">I mean, there was still a
lot of juice coming out,</p>
  <p time="507260" is_ac="false">slight bit of oil, few drops,</p>
  <p time="509570" is_ac="false">so I quite like that,
so I appreciate that.</p>
  <p time="517560" is_ac="false">We now head out of the city center</p>
  <p time="519497" is_ac="false">to visit Pizzaria La Notizia.</p>
  <p time="523900" is_ac="false">Antonio: La Notizia is
far from the center,</p>
  <p time="525765" is_ac="false">but it's a nice place because the owner,</p>
  <p time="528100" is_ac="false">Enzo Coccia, is a kind
of a bible of pizza.</p>
  <p time="531440" is_ac="false">He knows everything about the pizza,</p>
  <p time="533650" is_ac="false">and he has a kind of pizza</p>
  <p time="536480" is_ac="false">that tends to have more
high-quality ingredients,</p>
  <p time="539106" is_ac="false">so the price is higher than other places,</p>
  <p time="541600" is_ac="false">but it's worth it.</p>
  <p time="630801" is_ac="false">Welcome to Naples.</p>
  <p time="639230" is_ac="false">Harry: This one, the crust
looks a lot more, like,</p>
  <p time="640980" is_ac="false">evenly browned than previous ones,</p>
  <p time="642660" is_ac="false">where in the past it's been kinda, like,</p>
  <p time="644350" is_ac="false">pale in some spots and then
quite charred on the other.</p>
  <p time="646830" is_ac="false">This is more like an even golden brown,</p>
  <p time="648630" is_ac="false">which is interesting.</p>
  <p time="651100" is_ac="false">So, one thing they do here,</p>
  <p time="652250" is_ac="false">similarly to what they
were doing at Starita</p>
  <p time="654215" is_ac="false">is they actually add some
pecorino onto the pizza,</p>
  <p time="657100" is_ac="false">which to the sort of the purists</p>
  <p time="658670" is_ac="false">might be a little bit controversial,</p>
  <p time="660200" is_ac="false">but I'm interested to
see if it kinda, like,</p>
  <p time="661650" is_ac="false">adds another layer to
the classic margherita.</p>
  <p time="664160" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, I have my doubts because</p>
  <p time="665913" is_ac="false">I'm not a big fan of
grated cheese and pizza,</p>
  <p time="668670" is_ac="false">especially because there's
already mozzarella in there,</p>
  <p time="671410" is_ac="false">which is, like, the cheese, for me.</p>
  <p time="674730" is_ac="false">So, well, let's see.</p>
  <p time="676030" is_ac="false">You don't judge a book by
its cover, let's try it.</p>
  <p time="686720" is_ac="false">Yeah, you get quite a lot
of the pecorino, actually.</p>
  <p time="689990" is_ac="false">Harry: I quite like it.</p>
  <p time="691060" is_ac="false">Do you like it?</p>
  <p time="693100" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, it's not too bad, like,</p>
  <p time="694960" is_ac="false">I had it with, like, a lot of my,</p>
  <p time="698910" is_ac="false">the basil leaf on my slice,</p>
  <p time="700760" is_ac="false">and they blended together quite well,</p>
  <p time="703177" is_ac="false">like, the basil and the pecorino.</p>
  <p time="705092" is_ac="false">Harry: Yeah, I was gonna say
it's a lot more, like, sharp</p>
  <p time="707040" is_ac="false">compared to just mozzarella,</p>
  <p time="708380" is_ac="false">which can just kinda blend
into the sauce and other stuff,</p>
  <p time="711110" is_ac="false">so you actually get, like,
a cheesier taste with it.</p>
  <p time="713280" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, first bite
is definitely cheesy.</p>
  <p time="716560" is_ac="false">What do you think of the crust?</p>
  <p time="718090" is_ac="false">Harry: I think it's good.</p>
  <p time="718923" is_ac="false">It's got more chew to it than,</p>
  <p time="720690" is_ac="false">say, Sorbillo did,</p>
  <p time="722190" is_ac="false">but I quite like it, it's chewy,</p>
  <p time="723320" is_ac="false">and, again, it's useful 'cause
it just holds things better</p>
  <p time="726050" is_ac="false">if it's got a bit more,
like, strength to it.</p>
  <p time="728181" is_ac="false">Claudia: It's quite interesting
because, I don't know,</p>
  <p time="729593" is_ac="false">if you notice, like this one has, like,</p>
  <p time="731480" is_ac="false">it's quite similar in terms
of, like, the way it looks</p>
  <p time="733940" is_ac="false">to Sorbillo's, but then
its texture is quite, like,</p>
  <p time="738290" is_ac="false">it's just another game.</p>
  <p time="739846" is_ac="false">Like, it's much more uniform and, like,</p>
  <p time="744132" is_ac="false">it has a stronger bite,
which is definitely</p>
  <p time="747680" is_ac="false">slightly harder I would say.</p>
  <p time="753120" is_ac="false">Harry: Next, we head to our final stop.</p>
  <p time="755140" is_ac="false">Antica Pizzeria Da Michele.</p>
  <p time="759590" is_ac="false">It's known for its huge pizzas,</p>
  <p time="761370" is_ac="false">and it shot to fame when it was featured</p>
  <p time="762887" is_ac="false">in "Eat Pray Love,"
starring Julia Roberts.</p>
  <p time="768240" is_ac="false">Antonio: La Michele, of course,</p>
  <p time="769073" is_ac="false">is very famous for the
movie "Eat Pray Love,"</p>
  <p time="771960" is_ac="false">but also for its style.</p>
  <p time="773970" is_ac="false">It's called in Italian "a ruota di carro."</p>
  <p time="776310" is_ac="false">It's like wagon wheels.</p>
  <p time="778980" is_ac="false">It means nothing in English,</p>
  <p time="780250" is_ac="false">but it means that the,</p>
  <p time="781640" is_ac="false">it's so big, it's bigger
than the plate behind pizza.</p>
  <p time="861230" is_ac="false">Harry: This might be
the best-looking pizza</p>
  <p time="862900" is_ac="false">that we've had today.</p>
  <p time="864020" is_ac="false">I think in terms of,
like, they've really got</p>
  <p time="865670" is_ac="false">the kind of leopard-spotting on the crust</p>
  <p time="868100" is_ac="false">just really perfect.</p>
  <p time="869030" is_ac="false">It's a lovely golden-brown color,</p>
  <p time="870650" is_ac="false">then you've got a lot of
these charred spots going on.</p>
  <p time="872920" is_ac="false">The distribution of the
cheese looks quite good,</p>
  <p time="875100" is_ac="false">and you've got the basil as well.</p>
  <p time="876150" is_ac="false">It just all looks very picture-perfect.</p>
  <p time="878210" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, that's true,</p>
  <p time="879130" is_ac="false">and I also like the fact that you can see,</p>
  <p time="881690" is_ac="false">like, the tomato sauce sort of, like,</p>
  <p time="884033" is_ac="false">fading into the crust in here</p>
  <p time="885890" is_ac="false">and getting, like, sort of orangey.</p>
  <p time="887740" is_ac="false">Yeah, I agree. Like, you know,</p>
  <p time="889470" is_ac="false">if you want an Insta shot,</p>
  <p time="890900" is_ac="false">this is your pizza.</p>
  <p time="903462" is_ac="false">Are you channeling your
inner Julia Roberts?</p>
  <p time="905700" is_ac="false">How much of a relationship
are you having with</p>
  <p time="907369" is_ac="false">this pizza right now?</p>
  <p time="909010" is_ac="false">Harry: I'm, like, in a
committed relationship</p>
  <p time="911765" is_ac="false">with this pizza.</p>
  <p time="913300" is_ac="false">We're thinking about
buying a house together.</p>
  <p time="916320" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, yeah, I like this a lot.</p>
  <p time="922000" is_ac="false">Harry: I was also, I was
interested to hear that</p>
  <p time="923660" is_ac="false">they don't use olive oil here,</p>
  <p time="925380" is_ac="false">they use soy oil instead.</p>
  <p time="927870" is_ac="false">You get the kind of
texture that we're used to,</p>
  <p time="929950" is_ac="false">but I think,</p>
  <p time="931133" is_ac="false">I mean, I can definitely
taste a bit more of kinda</p>
  <p time="933570" is_ac="false">the mozzarella, I think,</p>
  <p time="935050" is_ac="false">and the tomato as well, so I
think it's a pretty good idea.</p>
  <p time="937780" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, definitely,</p>
  <p time="938613" is_ac="false">there was no oil at all in
the bite that I just gave,</p>
  <p time="942140" is_ac="false">it was really just, like, all the juices</p>
  <p time="943932" is_ac="false">from the mozzarella and the tomato.</p>
  <p time="945910" is_ac="false">Really couldn't taste the oil.</p>
  <p time="948110" is_ac="false">Harry: Yeah, I think the crust definitely</p>
  <p time="949300" is_ac="false">isn't quite as doughy as
we had it at La Natizia.</p>
  <p time="951846" is_ac="false">I've had to bring the flip
back to kinda make sure</p>
  <p time="953609" is_ac="false">that it doesn't fall apart on me too much,</p>
  <p time="956317" is_ac="false">but it's good.</p>
  <p time="957359" is_ac="false">It really is, it's less about the crust,</p>
  <p time="959207" is_ac="false">more about the toppings and, like,</p>
  <p time="960718" is_ac="false">the freshness of the tomato.</p>
  <p time="967000" is_ac="false">Claudia: Now it's time for us to decide</p>
  <p time="968830" is_ac="false">which pizza is the best of the best.</p>
  <p time="972580" is_ac="false">So, here we are,</p>
  <p time="973740" is_ac="false">we're standing in front of Mount Vesuvius,</p>
  <p time="976100" is_ac="false">which is Naples' iconic volcano,</p>
  <p time="978160" is_ac="false">and it is time to pick our winner.</p>
  <p time="981200" is_ac="false">Harry: We've eaten some
amazing pizzas today,</p>
  <p time="982800" is_ac="false">and picking a winner is
gonna be really tough,</p>
  <p time="985280" is_ac="false">but I'm fairly confident in my decision,</p>
  <p time="987500" is_ac="false">so I think we should see what we picked.</p>
  <p time="989770" is_ac="false">One, two, three.</p>
  <p time="993670" is_ac="false">Ah, OK.</p>
  <p time="994940" is_ac="false">Claudia: Oh, yeah, I see why
you're going for that one.</p>
  <p time="997845" is_ac="false">Harry: OK, we've got a split.</p>
  <p time="1000720" is_ac="false">So, let's see if one of us can convince</p>
  <p time="1002250" is_ac="false">the other to come around.</p>
  <p time="1003660" is_ac="false">So, why did you like Starita so much?</p>
  <p time="1005770" is_ac="false">Claudia: Well, the reason
why I like Starita was, like,</p>
  <p time="1008804" is_ac="false">because Don Antonio was, like,</p>
  <p time="1010270" is_ac="false">really, really bringing the vibe, like,</p>
  <p time="1013110" is_ac="false">up to the next level.</p>
  <p time="1014680" is_ac="false">Like, it was such a nice
character, and he's, like,</p>
  <p time="1017330" is_ac="false">among our top four and is, like,</p>
  <p time="1019840" is_ac="false">really making, like, a (chef's kiss),</p>
  <p time="1021828" is_ac="false">out-of-this-world product.</p>
  <p time="1025160" is_ac="false">And I also, yeah,</p>
  <p time="1026350" is_ac="false">I also liked the fact that he
put olive oil on top of it,</p>
  <p time="1029430" is_ac="false">which is something that
Da Michele doesn't have.</p>
  <p time="1033160" is_ac="false">Harry: So, you make some very good points.</p>
  <p time="1034850" is_ac="false">I went for Da Michele</p>
  <p time="1036750" is_ac="false">because it just kind of had
everything that you would expect</p>
  <p time="1039950" is_ac="false">from a traditional Neapolitan pizza joint.</p>
  <p time="1043100" is_ac="false">The vibe in there was great as well,</p>
  <p time="1044300" is_ac="false">it was very traditional, you
had the kind of tiled floors</p>
  <p time="1046670" is_ac="false">and tiled walls.</p>
  <p time="1047860" is_ac="false">It still looked the
same as it did back when</p>
  <p time="1050320" is_ac="false">Julia Roberts had a
relationship with her pizza</p>
  <p time="1053360" is_ac="false">back in "Eat Pray Love,"</p>
  <p time="1054780" is_ac="false">so I think, kind of, if you're a tourist</p>
  <p time="1056473" is_ac="false">who's coming to Naples and
looking for a Neapolitan pizza,</p>
  <p time="1059740" is_ac="false">I think that would give you maybe</p>
  <p time="1060940" is_ac="false">the best, like, touristy experience.</p>
  <p time="1063420" is_ac="false">Claudia: Wouldn't you say that, like,</p>
  <p time="1065460" is_ac="false">maybe Da Michele was what Starita is now</p>
  <p time="1068640" is_ac="false">about, like, 20 years ago?</p>
  <p time="1070293" is_ac="false">You know, when, like, the
owners were still, like,</p>
  <p time="1072600" is_ac="false">actually there making the pizza,</p>
  <p time="1074740" is_ac="false">you know, you were getting in and you were</p>
  <p time="1076536" is_ac="false">welcomed by, like, the old guy</p>
  <p time="1078002" is_ac="false">that was, like, very
passionate about their work</p>
  <p time="1079850" is_ac="false">and then they were showing
you around, you know.</p>
  <p time="1082270" is_ac="false">To me, that is, like,
really, really important,</p>
  <p time="1084670" is_ac="false">to have not only the product,</p>
  <p time="1086292" is_ac="false">but also, like, the person
that makes it, that likes,</p>
  <p time="1089470" is_ac="false">really really strongly loves it,</p>
  <p time="1091670" is_ac="false">and is still kind of, like,
there looking after tradition.</p>
  <p time="1096990" is_ac="false">Harry: I think I'm gonna
have to agree with you.</p>
  <p time="1098313" is_ac="false">I think if you want a
really authentic experience,</p>
  <p time="1101170" is_ac="false">Starita's the place to go,</p>
  <p time="1102202" is_ac="false">just because Don Antonio
loved what he did so much.</p>
  <p time="1105320" is_ac="false">It really did show,</p>
  <p time="1106330" is_ac="false">and the pizza had olive oil,</p>
  <p time="1107390" is_ac="false">which apparently is a
deal breaker for Claudia.</p>
  <p time="1109488" is_ac="false">Claudia: Yeah, no olive oil, no party.</p>
