  <p time="60" is_ac="true">so I recently spent four full days in</p>
  <p time="3060" is_ac="true">Amsterdam I'm a foodie at heart and I've</p>
  <p time="5400" is_ac="true">also been vegan for over six years now</p>
  <p time="7379" is_ac="true">and so I thought I would put together a</p>
  <p time="9059" is_ac="true">whole video dedicated to sharing with</p>
  <p time="10800" is_ac="true">you guys the best places to get food in</p>
  <p time="13019" is_ac="true">the city and everything is obviously</p>
  <p time="14820" is_ac="true">vegan so it's a vegan food guide to</p>
  <p time="17160" is_ac="true">Amsterdam definitely like this video if</p>
  <p time="19140" is_ac="true">you enjoy it and we'll dive straight</p>
  <p time="20699" is_ac="true">into breakfast ideas so this first place</p>
  <p time="22859" is_ac="true">is called coffee and uh cook I think I'm</p>
  <p time="25680" is_ac="true">saying that correctly and it's about a</p>
  <p time="27420" is_ac="true">30 minute walk from Amsterdam Central</p>
  <p time="29640" is_ac="true">and on their menu they do loads of</p>
  <p time="31679" is_ac="true">different hot and cold drinks as well as</p>
  <p time="33360" is_ac="true">breakfast pastries sandwiches and then</p>
  <p time="35460" is_ac="true">like dessert type things we're in coffee</p>
  <p time="38000" is_ac="true">and a cook it's a fully vegan place by</p>
  <p time="41760" is_ac="true">the way</p>
  <p time="44719" is_ac="true">and then Monica got the carrot cake</p>
  <p time="47460" is_ac="true">which looks really good like look the</p>
  <p time="50340" is_ac="true">layers is it good it's really good so if</p>
  <p time="52860" is_ac="true">you watched my Paris travel Vlog then</p>
  <p time="54600" is_ac="true">you'll know that we had a really good</p>
  <p time="55739" is_ac="true">croissants in Disneyland Paris and we're</p>
  <p time="57539" is_ac="true">on the hunt for even better ones</p>
  <p time="62039" is_ac="true">it's like eight yeah</p>
  <p time="65540" is_ac="true">sadly I don't think it was as good as</p>
  <p time="67920" is_ac="true">the one we had in Disneyland Paris but</p>
  <p time="69720" is_ac="true">the scoring was really good I don't know</p>
  <p time="71280" is_ac="true">why we were both just really craving uh</p>
  <p time="74040" is_ac="true">it's really a good scone it's so dense</p>
  <p time="77880" is_ac="true">really it's crumbly at the same time</p>
  <p time="79799" is_ac="true">let's see what the inside looks like</p>
  <p time="84600" is_ac="true">oh I don't know that was good I don't</p>
  <p time="86939" is_ac="true">know perfect quality skills though wow</p>
  <p time="88439" is_ac="true">yeah well done thank you okay so my</p>
  <p time="91140" is_ac="true">second place to get like coffee or a</p>
  <p time="93060" is_ac="true">breakfast or just like a late morning</p>
  <p time="94320" is_ac="true">snack is a place called coffee and</p>
  <p time="96299" is_ac="true">coconuts it's also a really cool</p>
  <p time="98540" is_ac="true">co-working space so you can just bring</p>
  <p time="100619" is_ac="true">your laptop there or just meet with a</p>
  <p time="102360" is_ac="true">friend and just work however it is like</p>
  <p time="104820" is_ac="true">a 45 minute walk away from the Central</p>
  <p time="107100" is_ac="true">Station so it's quite a trek but I would</p>
  <p time="109380" is_ac="true">definitely say it's worth it we are now</p>
  <p time="111299" is_ac="true">in coffee and coconuts which is a very</p>
  <p time="113820" is_ac="true">vibey place so they don't have very many</p>
  <p time="116220" is_ac="true">vegans but like the food seems pretty</p>
  <p time="118439" is_ac="true">like yeah yeah so we got Coke no we</p>
  <p time="122820" is_ac="true">didn't get coconuts we got coffee</p>
  <p time="124200" is_ac="true">because we're in coffee and coconut oil</p>
  <p time="126119" is_ac="true">first laughter I know this is my first</p>
  <p time="128039" is_ac="true">latte it looks really good with the</p>
  <p time="129660" is_ac="true">latte art even with oat milk like it's</p>
  <p time="132120" is_ac="true">so cute so in most places in Amsterdam</p>
  <p time="134520" is_ac="true">we found that you could easily get</p>
  <p time="135959" is_ac="true">alternative milks like oat milk for</p>
  <p time="137760" is_ac="true">example but I wouldn't say coffee and</p>
  <p time="139500" is_ac="true">coconuts is the most vegan friendly Cafe</p>
  <p time="141900" is_ac="true">like they had some smoothie bowls and a</p>
  <p time="144420" is_ac="true">few you items were vegan friendly but we</p>
  <p time="146940" is_ac="true">didn't get any food there just because</p>
  <p time="148200" is_ac="true">we weren't really feeling anything on</p>
  <p time="150120" is_ac="true">the menu and there weren't that many</p>
  <p time="151560" is_ac="true">options but Margo's on the other hand is</p>
  <p time="153660" is_ac="true">fully vegan and it's where we got lunch</p>
  <p time="155400" is_ac="true">on one day we're going to Margo's for</p>
  <p time="157800" is_ac="true">lunch menu it's very small it's like</p>
  <p time="161099" is_ac="true">sandwiches Toasties</p>
  <p time="163280" is_ac="true">plant-based and organic and organic dude</p>
  <p time="166200" is_ac="true">hello okay so I think I'm gonna go we're</p>
  <p time="169379" is_ac="true">still tandoori chicken tandoori chicken</p>
  <p time="171599" is_ac="true">which one the first one I might go for</p>
  <p time="173519" is_ac="true">like the katsu or poison a lot you</p>
  <p time="175500" is_ac="true">excited ready ready stomach is foolish</p>
  <p time="178019" is_ac="true">food yeah my blue stomach calling for</p>
  <p time="180599" is_ac="true">food about to turn it brown if you know</p>
  <p time="182160" is_ac="true">what I mean</p>
  <p time="184400" is_ac="true">so Margo's doesn't have a really</p>
  <p time="186720" is_ac="true">extensive food menu they mostly do like</p>
  <p time="189360" is_ac="true">sandwiches or baguettes and then</p>
  <p time="190920" is_ac="true">Toasties Angelo and I each got a</p>
  <p time="192599" is_ac="true">different baguette this is the hoisan</p>
  <p time="194420" is_ac="true">luck and that is the chicken with saitan</p>
  <p time="198060" is_ac="true">mmm</p>
  <p time="199800" is_ac="true">and they cut them for you it's so good</p>
  <p time="201780" is_ac="true">aesthetically</p>
  <p time="206519" is_ac="true">I'm a bit of a sucker for like hoisan</p>
  <p time="208620" is_ac="true">flavors so I honestly loved my baguette</p>
  <p time="211379" is_ac="true">and we both agreed that we think I had</p>
  <p time="213480" is_ac="true">the better one so if you're looking for</p>
  <p time="215220" is_ac="true">a quick place just to get lunch then I</p>
  <p time="217379" is_ac="true">definitely recommend Margo's whether</p>
  <p time="219000" is_ac="true">you're vegan or not and like all of</p>
  <p time="220739" is_ac="true">these recommendations</p>
  <p time="223980" is_ac="true">best sandwich I've had in a while</p>
  <p time="225599" is_ac="true">perfect amount of lettuce they cut it</p>
  <p time="227580" is_ac="true">for you taste was I took out the Chili</p>
  <p time="230400" is_ac="true">Peppers</p>
  <p time="233420" is_ac="true">how was yours amazing amazing they were</p>
  <p time="237540" is_ac="true">just a bit messy to eat but other than</p>
  <p time="238920" is_ac="true">that apples</p>
  <p time="241519" is_ac="true">yeah I think I have it everywhere you</p>
  <p time="244200" is_ac="true">guys I haven't worn my mouth right</p>
  <p time="247620" is_ac="true">more for me then this was a spontaneous</p>
  <p time="250439" is_ac="true">fine this wasn't even in our itinerary</p>
  <p time="252120" is_ac="true">I've had it this morning props to you we</p>
  <p time="254459" is_ac="true">were um showering and cleaning our</p>
  <p time="256979" is_ac="true">bodies we couldn't leave this place</p>
  <p time="258419" is_ac="true">without trying some of that desserts so</p>
  <p time="260820" is_ac="true">we also got that white chocolate and</p>
  <p time="263220" is_ac="true">matcha flavored cookie oh my gosh this</p>
  <p time="265380" is_ac="true">was so good as well as that lemon poppy</p>
  <p time="267900" is_ac="true">cake which kind of looked like a donut</p>
  <p time="268919" is_ac="true">which is broken oh this is a matcha</p>
  <p time="272759" is_ac="true">white chocolate cookie it's amazing</p>
  <p time="277400" is_ac="true">let's try this just in the middle of</p>
  <p time="279660" is_ac="true">this video I am gonna shout out Albert</p>
  <p time="281699" is_ac="true">hijin the supermarket chain in Amsterdam</p>
  <p time="284880" is_ac="true">we got some snacks there like a wrap for</p>
  <p time="287280" is_ac="true">example and we also got groceries so we</p>
  <p time="289199" is_ac="true">could cook in the hostel one evening</p>
  <p time="290699" is_ac="true">which does save you money when you are</p>
  <p time="292680" is_ac="true">out traveling but my next recommendation</p>
  <p time="294600" is_ac="true">for you guys is a place called Vagabond</p>
  <p time="296940" is_ac="true">so this is kind of like a shop and a</p>
  <p time="300419" is_ac="true">cafe so you can like buy really cool</p>
  <p time="303180" is_ac="true">items that are vegan zero waste and</p>
  <p time="305639" is_ac="true">really like sustainable or eco-friendly</p>
  <p time="307560" is_ac="true">as I said we also got a lunch here</p>
  <p time="309540" is_ac="true">because it has a cafe and I wouldn't</p>
  <p time="311580" is_ac="true">really trust their menu online because I</p>
  <p time="313500" is_ac="true">believe it changes every day so we just</p>
  <p time="315960" is_ac="true">got a plate filled with a selection of</p>
  <p time="318120" is_ac="true">different things so I tried this Korean</p>
  <p time="320220" is_ac="true">barbecue burger tofu the grain mix and</p>
  <p time="324060" is_ac="true">then this Caesar romaine lettuce boat</p>
  <p time="326460" is_ac="true">thing Angelo also tried the vegan quiche</p>
  <p time="328500" is_ac="true">which was Sensational and then we also</p>
  <p time="330840" is_ac="true">got dessert from them as well so both of</p>
  <p time="333120" is_ac="true">these were fully raw desserts the back</p>
  <p time="335100" is_ac="true">one was a vegan Snickers and then the</p>
  <p time="337680" is_ac="true">front one was a pecan caramel chocolate</p>
  <p time="340440" is_ac="true">square and oh my gosh you guys these</p>
  <p time="343020" is_ac="true">were both amazing and just so so well</p>
  <p time="345780" is_ac="true">made Vagabond is also one of the places</p>
  <p time="348000" is_ac="true">where you can find vegan Street waffles</p>
  <p time="350160" is_ac="true">which are a traditionally a Dutch food</p>
  <p time="352440" is_ac="true">item and you can find them as I said in</p>
  <p time="355080" is_ac="true">Vagabond they have like two flavors and</p>
  <p time="357479" is_ac="true">we also got them from a place called Eco</p>
  <p time="359820" is_ac="true">plats or Echo Plus these are the street</p>
  <p time="361560" is_ac="true">waffles that I showed you guys in the</p>
  <p time="362880" is_ac="true">video so we found them in two places</p>
  <p time="364440" is_ac="true">this Echo Plus shop that I didn't see</p>
  <p time="367080" is_ac="true">last time also a vagabond so Angela and</p>
  <p time="370139" is_ac="true">I got two packs of these and we bought</p>
  <p time="371639" is_ac="true">the spelter at once last year I got the</p>
  <p time="374400" is_ac="true">wheat syrup waffles Street waffles</p>
  <p time="376680" is_ac="true">they're kind of like a traditional well</p>
  <p time="378360" is_ac="true">are they a traditional Dutch thing I</p>
  <p time="379979" is_ac="true">think they are</p>
  <p time="381060" is_ac="true">um but these are vegan ones I actually</p>
  <p time="382560" is_ac="true">prefer these to the wheat syrup ones and</p>
  <p time="385139" is_ac="true">you're apparently supposed to put them</p>
  <p time="386400" is_ac="true">over a mug with a hot drink in and they</p>
  <p time="388319" is_ac="true">will soften so I'm yet to try that but a</p>
  <p time="391080" is_ac="true">kind of a random one for me a coffee</p>
  <p time="392639" is_ac="true">shop a recommendation where you can get</p>
  <p time="394380" is_ac="true">really good coffee because I'm getting</p>
  <p time="396120" is_ac="true">into it is a place called cafecito so</p>
  <p time="398220" is_ac="true">we're going to mawas today</p>
  <p time="400940" is_ac="true">is that the falafel place yes oh yeah</p>
  <p time="404580" is_ac="true">the Falafel thing you like customizer</p>
  <p time="407360" is_ac="true">Falafel thing I saw it last time I was</p>
  <p time="409740" is_ac="true">here but didn't go in basically we went</p>
  <p time="411720" is_ac="true">to wagamama's when we were last year so</p>
  <p time="413639" is_ac="true">yeah I didn't try any of the vegan food</p>
  <p time="415440" is_ac="true">hence why we're going all out this time</p>
  <p time="417240" is_ac="true">so the maua's that is closest to</p>
  <p time="419639" is_ac="true">Amsterdam Central is literally a 10</p>
  <p time="421680" is_ac="true">minute walk from the station but I</p>
  <p time="423660" is_ac="true">believe there is another store as well</p>
  <p time="426060" is_ac="true">but basically you choose whether you put</p>
  <p time="428880" is_ac="true">like Falafel or mushrooms in your Pitter</p>
  <p time="430979" is_ac="true">and then you just fill it up with</p>
  <p time="432419" is_ac="true">whichever fillings you want we're in</p>
  <p time="434160" is_ac="true">Mao's and I filled it way too</p>
  <p time="439500" is_ac="true">far yeah we have to use the chip thing</p>
  <p time="451160" is_ac="true">is on the less expensive side they have</p>
  <p time="454259" is_ac="true">like a mildew option and we also got</p>
  <p time="456960" is_ac="true">chips with our Falafel or mushroom wraps</p>
  <p time="460080" is_ac="true">so I choose the mushrooms actually got</p>
  <p time="461639" is_ac="true">the Falafel and something else that I</p>
  <p time="463500" is_ac="true">believe you can do in malwaz is get a</p>
  <p time="465599" is_ac="true">free refill so if you eat all of the</p>
  <p time="468479" is_ac="true">fillings in your pizza I think you can</p>
  <p time="470160" is_ac="true">go back for more I didn't try it out but</p>
  <p time="472139" is_ac="true">apparently it's true the next</p>
  <p time="474060" is_ac="true">recommendation then is a place called</p>
  <p time="475500" is_ac="true">soil so this is a Philly vegan Asian</p>
  <p time="478440" is_ac="true">inspired restaurant we were told so the</p>
  <p time="481020" is_ac="true">starters and the desserts aren't really</p>
  <p time="482699" is_ac="true">Asian inspired but all of their Mains</p>
  <p time="484560" is_ac="true">are so a lot of them use noodles and</p>
  <p time="487319" is_ac="true">they also have burgers that are very</p>
  <p time="490199" is_ac="true">Asian in Spanish we need soil</p>
  <p time="493880" is_ac="true">Caribbean so we tried the kebabs as a</p>
  <p time="497280" is_ac="true">starter and then Angelo got the memben</p>
  <p time="499500" is_ac="true">noodles for his main I got the</p>
  <p time="501360" is_ac="true">vermicelli noodle salad and then Monica</p>
  <p time="503699" is_ac="true">Angelo's sister got the Alexa Curry now</p>
  <p time="507000" is_ac="true">I think Angelo's was definitely the</p>
  <p time="508860" is_ac="true">favorite I did enjoy mine but I feel</p>
  <p time="512580" is_ac="true">like the tastes just would a bit too</p>
  <p time="515099" is_ac="true">monotonous after a while and next time</p>
  <p time="517140" is_ac="true">I'd probably go for one of their burgers</p>
  <p time="518700" is_ac="true">on the menu what is it tell them what it</p>

  <p time="649320" is_ac="true">just the best fries and finally we tried</p>
  <p time="651720" is_ac="true">their chocolate cake and the vegan</p>
  <p time="653820" is_ac="true">cheesecake the vegan cheesecake didn't</p>
