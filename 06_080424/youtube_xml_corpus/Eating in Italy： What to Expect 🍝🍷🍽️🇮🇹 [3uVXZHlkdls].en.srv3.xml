  <p time="173760" is_ac="true">included and they'll keep bringing out</p>
  <p time="175200" is_ac="true">water all the time in Europe and yet</p>
  <p time="177900" is_ac="true">here in Italy it's different when you</p>
  <p time="180599" is_ac="true">sit down they're not going to bring you</p>
  <p time="181800" is_ac="true">water right away and when you're ready</p>
  <p time="183420" is_ac="true">for water you need to ask them in this</p>
  <p time="186300" is_ac="true">case they brought us water from the tap</p>
  <p time="188400" is_ac="true">and the phrase for that is aqua Del</p>

  <p time="219780" is_ac="true">you sit down down and now the bread</p>
  <p time="221340" is_ac="true">they'll always put it down on the table</p>
  <p time="222959" is_ac="true">when you sit down keep in mind though</p>
  <p time="225060" is_ac="true">you're going to pay for that at the end</p>
  <p time="226620" is_ac="true">and I'll get into that why you'll pay</p>
  <p time="228840" is_ac="true">for that now if you don't want bread you</p>
  <p time="230819" is_ac="true">can let them know and have them hold it</p>
  <p time="232319" is_ac="true">not bring it but I don't know why you</p>
  <p time="234000" is_ac="true">wouldn't want some of this deliciousness</p>
  <p time="235220" is_ac="true">but let's talk about the ice because</p>
  <p time="237599" is_ac="true">it's not a big thing here in Europe</p>
  <p time="240360" is_ac="true">typically the United States you'd always</p>
  <p time="242040" is_ac="true">get ice with your drinks a lot of ice</p>
  <p time="244560" is_ac="true">well here if you order a soda they'll</p>
  <p time="247140" is_ac="true">bring it out to just cold not with ice</p>
  <p time="249900" is_ac="true">so you need to ask for ice if you want</p>
  <p time="252360" is_ac="true">it now keep in mind there's sodas</p>

  <p time="574019" is_ac="true">order a plate of pasta get a primo and</p>
  <p time="576839" is_ac="true">maybe a dessert afterwards or if you</p>
  <p time="578580" is_ac="true">want to sit down and just order sekondo</p>
  <p time="581160" is_ac="true">a second dish a meat or a fish plate you</p>
  <p time="583800" is_ac="true">can do that too so however you want to</p>
  <p time="585420" is_ac="true">mix and match feel free to do so and if</p>
  <p time="588180" is_ac="true">you want to order the whole menu also do</p>
  <p time="590399" is_ac="true">that also keep in mind that the plates</p>
  <p time="592380" is_ac="true">they'll come one after another they</p>
  <p time="594300" is_ac="true">don't bring all those plates out at one</p>
  <p time="596640" is_ac="true">time and it's rare that you'll find here</p>
  <p time="599279" is_ac="true">in Italy like you could see in the</p>
  <p time="601260" is_ac="true">United States that you see a combination</p>
  <p time="603180" is_ac="true">plate where they pile different things</p>
  <p time="604860" is_ac="true">on one plate they don't typically do</p>
  <p time="607440" is_ac="true">that in fact when you eat in Italy it's</p>
  <p time="610140" is_ac="true">a slow process so just sit back and</p>
  <p time="612959" is_ac="true">relax I want to talk a little bit about</p>
  <p time="614760" is_ac="true">substitution because oftentimes in the</p>
  <p time="617519" is_ac="true">United States if you don't like certain</p>
  <p time="619260" is_ac="true">ingredients you can ask for one to be</p>
  <p time="621120" is_ac="true">pulled out of the menu item and</p>
  <p time="623519" is_ac="true">substituted with another well here in</p>
  <p time="625560" is_ac="true">Italy you can't do that maybe they'll</p>
  <p time="628080" is_ac="true">take out a certain ingredient if you're</p>
  <p time="630000" is_ac="true">allergic to it or something but they're</p>
  <p time="631380" is_ac="true">not going to switch things up don't</p>
  <p time="633360" is_ac="true">expect to get a pasta a la carbonara</p>
  <p time="635839" is_ac="true">with chicken instead of pork it just</p>
  <p time="638940" is_ac="true">ain't gonna happen here so this is our</p>
  <p time="640860" is_ac="true">second course our secondo dish and they</p>
  <p time="644100" is_ac="true">just brought out our Contour no our side</p>
  <p time="646140" is_ac="true">dish with it as well and this is some</p>

  <p time="649860" is_ac="true">with our second course as you may have</p>
  <p time="652320" is_ac="true">noticed eating in Italy it's a slow</p>

  <p time="662760" is_ac="true">as they can to maximize their profits</p>
  <p time="664920" is_ac="true">here it's a slow pace one dish and you</p>
