  <p time="6960" is_ac="false">Home to over 9 million people Mexico City is 
the largest populated city in north America and  </p>
  <p time="12400" is_ac="false">when it comes to food they know how to throw it 
down but can this city also master a vegan scene  </p>
  <p time="18080" is_ac="false">I'm Eunice and i'm going to show you 
where to eat iconic vegan Mexican dishes  </p>
  <p time="22240" is_ac="false">their stories and what sites 
you need to see let's go!</p>
  <p time="30160" is_ac="false">If there's one taco you must eat 
in Mexico city it's the al pastor  </p>
  <p time="33920" is_ac="false">because it's everywhere but if you're 
vegan there's no need to have fomo  </p>
  <p time="38560" is_ac="false">so why is this taco so iconic in the 1930s 
a wave of Lebanese immigrants arrived to  </p>
  <p time="43920" is_ac="false">Mexico and introduced shawarma meat cooked 
on a rotating spit by the 1960s Mexican-born  </p>
  <p time="49600" is_ac="false">children of these immigrants began opening their 
own restaurants and combined their heritage  </p>
  <p time="53680" is_ac="false">with a Mexican twist hence the al pastor taco was 
born so what's the story behind the restaurant</p>
  <p time="96880" is_ac="false">every day the vegan al pastor is made of wheat 
gluten and marinated for 24 hours then it's  </p>
  <p time="102080" is_ac="false">hand-picked to form the perfect shape on the spit 
the iconic pineapple is then placed on the spit as  </p>
  <p time="107520" is_ac="false">the base for the meat to be formed and cut and 
grilled for the perfect juicy crisp then it's,  </p>
  <p time="120880" is_ac="false">of course, served with locally made tortillas 
garnished and topped with the iconic pineapple,  </p>
  <p time="126480" is_ac="false">okay and now it's time for the best part to 
try the al pastor tacos that they are known for  </p>
  <p time="133280" is_ac="false">I have been eyeing this thing just from seeing it 
on the spit oh my gosh it looks absolutely amazing  </p>
  <p time="139520" is_ac="false">i topped it off with the guacamole salsa 
it's guacamole so it's the spiciest one  </p>
  <p time="144800" is_ac="false">that they have here at the restaurant they 
served you with beans on the side it's just  </p>
  <p time="150240" is_ac="false">I love that they put the double tortilla so it's 
like a really good filling meal all right cheers</p>
  <p time="164080" is_ac="false">I love that the meat is like really juicy inside  </p>
  <p time="167360" is_ac="false">and has that nice char on the outside the color 
is beautiful it's due to that adobo sauce that  </p>
  <p time="172160" is_ac="false">they put on top if you're a meat-lover 
I challenge you to try this it's so good</p>
  <p time="179680" is_ac="false">it's the perfect spice level has 
great flavor it doesn't feel dry  </p>
  <p time="184400" is_ac="false">it feels meaty it hits that spot for that craving 
that you want especially if you're in Mexico city  </p>
  <p time="189680" is_ac="false">you want el pastor tacos come on like that's what 
they're known for here so you don't have to miss  </p>
  <p time="193680" is_ac="false">out you get to enjoy in that as well I love that 
the pineapple gives that touch of sweetness the  </p>
  <p time="198320" is_ac="false">lemon that you put on top is great you have to 
get this but wait there's more Por Siempre Vegana  </p>
  <p time="204720" is_ac="false">offers an extensive menu and another of their 
stars is the molcajete a dish where the specialty  </p>
  <p time="210080" is_ac="false">is grilled vegan meat grilled cactus aka nopal, 
chiles serrano, onion and of course avocado.  </p>
  <p time="219600" is_ac="false">Once the meat is perfectly grilled it's placed in 
the hot molcajete topped with salsa grilled onions  </p>
  <p time="226400" is_ac="false">serrano chilies crispy melted cheese and 
avocado and now you're ready to feast</p>
  <p time="236400" is_ac="false">this is a specialty dish that's 
common here in Mexico city as well  </p>
  <p time="240080" is_ac="false">this is an experience and of course 
they serve it to you with hot tortillas  </p>
  <p time="244400" is_ac="false">so I'm gonna dig in oh my word 
i don't even know where to start  </p>
  <p time="248480" is_ac="false">when they were grilling this meat it looked so 
real i was like i could fool anyone with this</p>
  <p time="256800" is_ac="false">oh my word I just want everything 
look how beautiful this avocado looks  </p>
  <p time="262640" is_ac="false">oh this is more of like a build 
your own taco type of thing  </p>
  <p time="268800" is_ac="false">I'm just gonna dip it all in this 
salsa I'm dying here all right cheers</p>
  <p time="286720" is_ac="false">you guys I haven't had grilled meat like this like 
carne asada in a long time this straight up gives  </p>
  <p time="293360" is_ac="false">me the fix brings back memories this is amazing 
like highly recommend you have to try this bring  </p>
  <p time="298960" is_ac="false">a friend feast enjoy their whole menu they offer 
so many other things they have bread desserts  </p>
  <p time="304560" is_ac="false">breakfast you name it they got it 
to have the street food experience  </p>
  <p time="309440" is_ac="false">good economical delicious you gotta do it</p>
  <p time="315360" is_ac="false">the next day was gonna be an adventure so i 
started with a fresh green juice by the many  </p>
  <p time="319520" is_ac="false">local fruit stands that you can find and 
then stop by Vegamo for a popular seasonal  </p>
  <p time="323600" is_ac="false">bread called pan de muerto since i was traveling 
during the days approaching the day of the dead  </p>
  <p time="328480" is_ac="false">this sweet fluffy bread is 
traditionally far from vegan but  </p>
  <p time="331840" is_ac="false">so many vegan restaurants were 
offering them I couldn't resist</p>
  <p time="342400" is_ac="false">but the real treat was visiting Xochimilco a 
tourist attraction that you cannot miss so if  </p>
  <p time="348000" is_ac="false">you're going to Mexico City it's 100 worth it 
to make the trip to sochimilco it's about a 40  </p>
  <p time="353360" is_ac="false">minute drive outside of the city but it's a really 
inexpensive uber drive it's about 10 us dollars  </p>
  <p time="359440" is_ac="false">the reason you have to come here is because 
as soon as you get here it's a canal with  </p>
  <p time="363360" is_ac="false">all these beautiful colored boats and it is an 
experience and a half you get here you can hire  </p>
  <p time="369200" is_ac="false">your own private mariachis they make you food 
on the go like as you're on the canal these  </p>
  <p time="374000" is_ac="false">little boats that have tacos and everything making 
stuff if you're vegan your only option is squash  </p>
  <p time="379440" is_ac="false">blossom flour that's what i have but they serve 
it to you with the sliced nopales of the cactus  </p>
  <p time="384080" is_ac="false">so that was really good to have it was delicious 
it seemed simple but it was amazing and then of  </p>
  <p time="388800" is_ac="false">course the roasted corn with salt and lime 
it's amazing definitely recommend to do it  </p>
  <p time="412000" is_ac="false">the next morning it was time to try the best 
iconic treat in mexico churros okay it's not  </p>
  <p time="418720" is_ac="false">a complete trip to mexico without churros now 
mexican churros tend to have egg in them and are  </p>
  <p time="425600" is_ac="false">sometimes made with butter so oftentimes people 
think they're not available vegan but here in  </p>
  <p time="430320" is_ac="false">mexico city there's a chain called el moro that 
is popular amongst all people non-vegans as well  </p>
  <p time="436560" is_ac="false">because they make vegan churros and you can have 
them in a bunch of different ways and they even  </p>
  <p time="441440" is_ac="false">have a vegan hot chocolate that they make without 
milk it's chocolate konawa so chocolate with water  </p>
  <p time="447600" is_ac="false">and it's spiced and oh my goodness everything 
they do here is absolutely delicious they make  </p>
  <p time="453280" is_ac="false">thousands of churros a day people line up out 
the doors at night is when it gets really busy  </p>
  <p time="460000" is_ac="false">locals come in here and enjoy like you seriously 
cannot pass this up they offer different kinds  </p>
  <p time="467200" is_ac="false">like just with cinnamon and sugar or just 
plain sugar i of course got cinnamon and sugar  </p>
  <p time="472240" is_ac="false">because that's the best way to go that's the 
perfect combination so i'm gonna try this</p>
  <p time="491440" is_ac="false">this is absolutely delicious so the churros are a 
Spanish influence here that's where it comes from  </p>
  <p time="497840" is_ac="false">and it's interesting because the spanish churros 
are made with oil, water and flour there's no egg  </p>
  <p time="505280" is_ac="false">so you can tell that they kind 
of adopted that recipe here  </p>
  <p time="509120" is_ac="false">and they kind of have put their own spin on 
it with the cinnamon and sugar to make it more  </p>
  <p time="514320" is_ac="false">mexican style and it's just it has that perfect 
chew still because that's the thing with mexican  </p>
  <p time="519840" is_ac="false">churros is they have a good chew to it this 
has the perfect crisp and chew and cinnamon  </p>
  <p time="525120" is_ac="false">and sugar and it's delicious the chocolate's 
amazing you just have to come here before  </p>
  <p time="531520" is_ac="false">heading to my lunch spot i decided to walk 
through one of the largest city parks in  </p>
  <p time="535040" is_ac="false">the western hemisphere el bosque de chapultepec 
think of it as the central park of mexico city</p>
  <p time="543840" is_ac="false">but of course it was time to 
eat again so i headed straight  </p>
  <p time="546480" is_ac="false">toward gatorta for vegan street food at its finest  </p>
  <p time="554320" is_ac="false">okay so another thing you have to try when you're 
in mexico are tortas for those of you who don't  </p>
  <p time="558640" is_ac="false">know tortas are basically giant sandwiches 
i've gotten their most popular option which  </p>
  <p time="563040" is_ac="false">is milanesa with salchica which is thin meat 
and hot dogs and it comes with beans and avocado  </p>
  <p time="569440" is_ac="false">cheese salsa grilled onions pickles like 
vegan mayo you name it they wrap it in  </p>
  <p time="576880" is_ac="false">plastic for you because not only is it to 
go it gets messy so let's give this a try ah</p>
  <p time="589120" is_ac="false">oh my god</p>
  <p time="594960" is_ac="false">this is definitely super meaty again the milanesa 
is like a thin breaded meat they make everything  </p>
  <p time="600720" is_ac="false">in house except for the hot dog if you want 
a torta experience this is where you got to  </p>
  <p time="604560" is_ac="false">come check it out because they have a bunch of 
different other things like al pastor etc about 30  </p>
  <p time="609200" is_ac="false">of their customers are non-vegan and they 
really enjoy it so it just goes to show  </p>
  <p time="613680" is_ac="false">how much an advancement they're making here 
in mexico city so if you want to try virgin  </p>
  <p time="618560" is_ac="false">tortas you gotta come here and check it 
out i'm just gonna keep feasting on this</p>
  <p time="624640" is_ac="false">and because there's one on almost every 
block i had to go to la michoacana paleta  </p>
  <p time="628560" is_ac="false">shop for a coconut palette aka a coconut 
popsicle made with water and not milk  </p>
  <p time="634160" is_ac="false">but this was so creamy and straight 
coconut that you wouldn't have never known</p>
  <p time="641920" is_ac="false">there's no better way to burn off your lunch than 
some shopping so i had to check out the ciudadella  </p>
  <p time="646480" is_ac="false">market a traditional style mexican market that 
specializes in the sale of mexican handcrafts  </p>
  <p time="651440" is_ac="false">and folk art the market is the first of its kind 
in the country and was established just before the  </p>
  <p time="656240" is_ac="false">1968 summer olympics to promote mexico's cultural 
heritage and it's home to over 350 vendors</p>
  <p time="666160" is_ac="false">on that note it was time to finish my night at one 
of mexico city's most instagrammable restaurants  </p>
  <p time="671280" is_ac="false">so i've just arrived to La Pitahaya mexico 
city's most instagramable vegan spot  </p>
  <p time="676080" is_ac="false">because they are known for their pink 
tortillas so you can just imagine the  </p>
  <p time="680240" is_ac="false">beautiful photos that come out of 
that so i came here to check it out  </p>
  <p time="683360" is_ac="false">because i couldn't resist because i 
want to see if it's worth the height</p>
  <p time="691040" is_ac="false">so why are the pink tortillas 
so iconic what's the story  </p>
  <p time="696080" is_ac="false">so it's actually a funny story of why these pink 
tortillas started so the owner one day bought a  </p>
  <p time="703440" is_ac="false">pack of masa to make tortillas and beet juice and 
on his way home it spilled all over the muslin and  </p>
  <p time="710000" is_ac="false">made it pink but he's like whatever i'm gonna 
make tortillas anyways and voila this was born  </p>
  <p time="714080" is_ac="false">and it's made it all over the gram i got their 
green enchiladas with the famous pink tortillas  </p>
  <p time="719680" is_ac="false">and i gotta say this looks amazing so far visually 
it's already kind of reaching up the hype i got  </p>
  <p time="726400" is_ac="false">the extra chickpea chorizo it looks straight 
up like chorizo i can't believe it's actually  </p>
  <p time="732240" is_ac="false">made out of garbanzo beans but all right enough 
said let's give this a try they make the tortillas  </p>
  <p time="737680" is_ac="false">to order so they have an open kitchen and 
you can just see them preparing the order  </p>
  <p time="741840" is_ac="false">which is kind of nice oh this green salsa looks 
absolutely amazing all right let's check it out</p>
  <p time="758160" is_ac="false">okay it lives up to the height the filling 
of the enchiladas are hibiscus flour jamaica  </p>
  <p time="764960" is_ac="false">and mushrooms and they chop it up finely 
so it resembles like that meaty texture  </p>
  <p time="771120" is_ac="false">the vegan chorizo this is just 
the green salsa is is good like  </p>
  <p time="778160" is_ac="false">it has a great flavor winner it's it is spicy 
which is good it's not too spicy so i might  </p>
  <p time="783040" is_ac="false">add extra hot sauce but i think it lives up to 
the hype the food is beautiful it tastes good  </p>
  <p time="788080" is_ac="false">they have a lot of other things with their menu 
like tacos so yeah definitely worth checking out</p>
  <p time="795840" is_ac="false">there's so much to see in mexico city so if you 
want to see what the city is like walk the streets  </p>
  <p time="800960" is_ac="false">meet the people and eat the food 
catch you next time on rated v  </p>
