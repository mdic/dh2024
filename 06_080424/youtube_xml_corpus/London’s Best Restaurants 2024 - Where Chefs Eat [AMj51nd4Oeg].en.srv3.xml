  <p time="160" is_ac="false">This film is all about the best places
to eat and drink in London right now.</p>
  <p time="3610" is_ac="false">That's smooth, baby.</p>
  <p time="5050" is_ac="false">We have interviewed over 130 of the</p>
  <p time="6870" is_ac="false">leading chefs, hospitality kingpins and
celebs on their favourite London spots.</p>
  <p time="11280" is_ac="false">And we've done a fair bit
of research ourselves.</p>
  <p time="13090" is_ac="false">We're super proud of this list,
everything from pizza to fine dining.</p>
  <p time="16680" is_ac="false">Over the next two days, we're going to</p>
  <p time="18220" is_ac="false">show you some of our most
loved spots in our hometown.</p>
  <p time="21210" is_ac="false">It's so good.</p>
  <p time="22280" is_ac="false">Hey, I'm Jesse behind the camera's
Will, and together we are TOPJAW.</p>
  <p time="25200" is_ac="false">If you're a Londoner and you haven't been</p>
  <p time="26680" is_ac="false">to the Regency cafe,
you're doing it wrong.</p>
  <p time="28640" is_ac="false">Now, we're probably not the first one to</p>
  <p time="29640" is_ac="false">tell you about this place, but
it's an absolute institution.</p>
  <p time="32290" is_ac="false">I'm having a really nice time in here.</p>
  <p time="34530" is_ac="false">It's a reasonably militant operation in</p>
  <p time="36560" is_ac="false">there, so I recommend
you get your order ready.</p>
  <p time="38680" is_ac="false">It's the first time for
both of us, isn't it?</p>
  <p time="40240" is_ac="false">No, I've been here before.
All right, fair enough.</p>
  <p time="41880" is_ac="false">No, just me, then.
No, I've been doing it wrong.</p>
  <p time="44400" is_ac="false">Even if you haven't been to
Regency, you might recognise it.</p>
  <p time="46680" is_ac="false">It's been a film set for so many things,</p>
  <p time="48490" is_ac="false">like Rocketman, Layer Cake, Brian Rock
and like loads of photo shoots and stuff.</p>
  <p time="53610" is_ac="false">It's a real time warp in here and
the prices feel pretty 1999, too.</p>
  <p time="57730" is_ac="false">We're paying like six quid for sourdough
bread these days in restaurants.</p>
  <p time="61410" is_ac="false">They'll do a whole
breakfast here for that.</p>
  <p time="64490" is_ac="false">Yay.
There's nothing they won't serve you.</p>
  <p time="66920" is_ac="false">You could just have a plate of beans
or beans or toast if you wanted to.</p>
  <p time="69690" is_ac="false">Dip the chip.
But we went for set breakfast and then the</p>
  <p time="72240" is_ac="false">black pudding, the mushrooms, the bubble
and squeak are extras that you can add on.</p>
  <p time="76210" is_ac="false">Bubble and squeak is like potato
and cabbage, mashed up, fried.</p>
  <p time="80280" is_ac="false">Tell you what, it's a
pretty good banger, innit?</p>
  <p time="82640" is_ac="false">We're still in the same family and
right now it's with Marco in charge.</p>
  <p time="86040" is_ac="false">Thank you.
Thank you very much.</p>
  <p time="87490" is_ac="false">Thank you, Marco.
Best pizza.</p>
  <p time="89760" is_ac="false">Crisp.
Crisp, obviously.</p>
  <p time="91320" is_ac="false">Crisp pizza.</p>
  <p time="92730" is_ac="false">Worth the trip to W6.</p>
  <p time="94290" is_ac="false">It is Crisp.</p>
  <p time="95810" is_ac="false">Unbelievable pizza.</p>
  <p time="97040" is_ac="false">When asked where the best pizza in London</p>
  <p time="99010" is_ac="false">is, there is no doubt in
our mind, is there, Will?</p>
  <p time="101730" is_ac="false">It's not.
It's crisp.</p>
  <p time="103240" is_ac="false">And that's probably the quickest answer we</p>
  <p time="104830" is_ac="false">can give to any restaurant related
question that London threw at us.</p>
  <p time="109170" is_ac="false">Chefs love this place and it's not in</p>
  <p time="111570" is_ac="false">central town, it's out in W6, out in
Hammersmith, in a residential area.</p>
  <p time="115360" is_ac="false">It's a little sleepy pub has been for a</p>
  <p time="117070" is_ac="false">long time until Carl came
along with his magical pizza.</p>
  <p time="120930" is_ac="false">This is your nan's pub?</p>
  <p time="122600" is_ac="false">41 years.</p>
  <p time="123960" is_ac="false">40 years, February it would have been.</p>
  <p time="125640" is_ac="false">So this kind of feels like home to you.
Yeah, massively.</p>
  <p time="127810" is_ac="false">Here we go.
First pint of the 48 hours in.</p>
  <p time="130400" is_ac="false">It's not even 11:00 a.
m.</p>
  <p time="131320" is_ac="false">Yeah.
That's mental.</p>
  <p time="132360" is_ac="false">That's disgusting.
That's really bad.</p>
  <p time="133800" is_ac="false">Yeah.
Walk me through these components.</p>
  <p time="135480" is_ac="false">So how do you make italian
ingredients crisp up like you do?</p>
  <p time="138640" is_ac="false">It's just trial and error.</p>
  <p time="139840" is_ac="false">It was just years and years of trying.</p>
  <p time="141570" is_ac="false">Every flour, German American
flour, Italian flour.</p>
  <p time="144640" is_ac="false">I tried bottled water,
tap water, filtered water.</p>
  <p time="147800" is_ac="false">Tap water's the best.
And we use salt, obviously, and oil.</p>
  <p time="150690" is_ac="false">You know, Neapolitan places don't use, so.</p>
  <p time="152880" is_ac="false">But I think it's the
oil that crisps it up.</p>
  <p time="154560" is_ac="false">Where you starting?
Well, I haven't tried the Picante.</p>
  <p time="156720" is_ac="false">This was meant to be a little
limited edition, much like the Vecna.</p>
  <p time="159480" is_ac="false">Yes.
And then it went down really well.</p>
  <p time="161320" is_ac="false">Yep.
That's my favourite now.</p>
  <p time="162560" is_ac="false">Mmm.
That's nice.</p>
  <p time="163360" is_ac="false">Right, so this is the Vecna.</p>
  <p time="164610" is_ac="false">So this was a Halloween special
Vecna off of Stranger Things.</p>
  <p time="168040" is_ac="false">And this was the first and only
hot honey pizza that Carl did.</p>
  <p time="171080" is_ac="false">And it's really gone down a storm.</p>
  <p time="172360" is_ac="false">It's a lot of people's favourite.
Yeah, that's it.</p>
  <p time="174350" is_ac="false">It's always been my favourite.</p>
  <p time="176640" is_ac="false">Still the best pizza in London.</p>
  <p time="177920" is_ac="false">Jess, what were your top tips for
someone coming down to Crisp be?</p>
  <p time="180960" is_ac="false">It's not an impulse place.</p>
  <p time="182120" is_ac="false">Book it a couple of weeks in advance.</p>
  <p time="183330" is_ac="false">And when you do come,
Picante &amp; Vecna, I reckon.</p>
  <p time="185760" is_ac="false">Yeah, Picante, Vecna.
Currently.</p>
  <p time="186350" is_ac="false">Don't know.</p>
  <p time="188920" is_ac="false">This is like Black Axe Mangal,
aka F.K.A.B.A.M.</p>
  <p time="194440" is_ac="false">It's approaching it's 10th year
of being an essential London restaurant.</p>
  <p time="198050" is_ac="false">Lee Tiernan spent many years as Head
Chef at St John Bread and Wines.</p>
  <p time="201960" is_ac="false">He's got great provenance, but it's in</p>
  <p time="203690" is_ac="false">this place he's let his
imagination really run wild.</p>
  <p time="206730" is_ac="false">Black Axe originated in Copenhagen.</p>
  <p time="208760" is_ac="false">It was a nightclub called Baggen.</p>
  <p time="210120" is_ac="false">We played really loud
music, people were moshing.</p>
  <p time="212320" is_ac="false">It was supposed to be just quick
kebabs, and it essentially was.</p>
  <p time="215080" is_ac="false">And by the time it came to open our own
spot, we couldn't think of another name</p>
  <p time="218920" is_ac="false">and we had quite a bit of traction,
so Black Axe Mangal stuck.</p>
  <p time="222000" is_ac="false">So Lee says this place isn't for everyone.</p>
  <p time="224490" is_ac="false">Absolutely no circumstance.</p>
  <p time="227250" is_ac="false">It's Coldplay.
What did you say?</p>
  <p time="230090" is_ac="false">Coldplay.
Oasis and The Cure.</p>
  <p time="232010" is_ac="false">Coldplay.
Oasis and The Cure.</p>
  <p time="233930" is_ac="false">Anyone plays, those are sacked.</p>
  <p time="238720" is_ac="false">I hope you're hungry, bruv.</p>
  <p time="240290" is_ac="false">Oh, my God, look at that.
That's smoked cod's roe.</p>
  <p time="242640" is_ac="false">You should cut into it fairly
soon before the yolk seizes up.</p>
  <p time="245610" is_ac="false">That's incredible.</p>
  <p time="246680" is_ac="false">This is one of my favourite salads
we've come up with recently.</p>
  <p time="248730" is_ac="false">It's a smoked pork neck
with a tomato sauce.</p>
  <p time="251720" is_ac="false">Do you need a plate?
For you, lamb waffle flatbread.</p>
  <p time="254440" is_ac="false">That's predominantly
liver and heart on there.</p>
  <p time="256280" is_ac="false">It's got testicles on it.</p>
  <p time="258360" is_ac="false">All you can really taste is, like,
really tender, soft lamb meat.</p>
  <p time="261560" is_ac="false">These are what you can smell when you
walked in all that, like, cumin and stuff.</p>
  <p time="264250" is_ac="false">I mean, they're not the most glamorous
thing to eat, but, hell, they are tasty.</p>
  <p time="268200" is_ac="false">One of my favourite things to do is to
eat food and not choose off the menu.</p>
  <p time="271890" is_ac="false">So original, so delicious.</p>
  <p time="273960" is_ac="false">If you're lucky enough to meet Lee.</p>
  <p time="275280" is_ac="false">Make sure you chew his ear
off and get some stories.</p>
  <p time="279120" is_ac="false">For the best burger in London question,
Black Bear does get called out sometimes.</p>
  <p time="283120" is_ac="false">But, nowhere near as much as it should.</p>
  <p time="285010" is_ac="false">It is so good.</p>
  <p time="286210" is_ac="false">Is it underrated?
Yes.</p>
  <p time="288240" is_ac="false">Is it the best burger in London?
Yes.</p>
  <p time="290480" is_ac="false">Narrowly, perhaps beaten
by Elliot at Lagom.</p>
  <p time="293160" is_ac="false">And that burger has to be tried, however,</p>
  <p time="295600" is_ac="false">bsolutelya banging, you know,
dirty, indulgent burger.</p>
  <p time="300210" is_ac="false">Black Bear is where I like to go.</p>
  <p time="302280" is_ac="false">Why did you start Black
Bear and why burgers?</p>
  <p time="304640" is_ac="false">Burgers was, like, at the centre and we</p>
  <p time="306360" is_ac="false">wanted to do the best burger
that we could, like, ever do.</p>
  <p time="308800" is_ac="false">People come for the burgers, but then they</p>
  <p time="310480" is_ac="false">try the sides and then that's
what they start talking about.</p>
  <p time="312410" is_ac="false">So we designed chicken
nuggets, brisket, sping rolls.</p>
  <p time="315220" is_ac="false">We do like this rare
bit crumpet now as well.</p>
  <p time="317720" is_ac="false">Yeah.
I always forget how good that is.</p>
  <p time="320210" is_ac="false">Give me that Death Row burger.</p>
  <p time="321770" is_ac="false">Thank you very much, dude mama.</p>
  <p time="324210" is_ac="false">But the proportions of this
single burger is just right.</p>
  <p time="327800" is_ac="false">Such beautiful beef you have that, like,</p>
  <p time="329850" is_ac="false">rich, velvety cheese
and the tangy onion jam.</p>
  <p time="332850" is_ac="false">I love how sesame heavy these buns are.</p>
  <p time="335040" is_ac="false">And they're made
specifically for Black Bear.</p>
  <p time="337410" is_ac="false">This is their beef brisket bun.</p>
  <p time="339770" is_ac="false">The beef is braised for
12 hours in beer, no less.</p>
  <p time="343040" is_ac="false">Little pink pickled onions,
garlic mayo, cheese.</p>
  <p time="346410" is_ac="false">I think we need to get out of here,
Will, or else we'll be keeling over.</p>
  <p time="352080" is_ac="false">Mate.
Next on the list.</p>
  <p time="353160" is_ac="false">Don't think we've been here before.</p>
  <p time="354240" is_ac="false">If you've even watched the smattering
of our stuff on Instagram or TikTok.</p>
  <p time="357480" is_ac="false">Best bar or pub?</p>
  <p time="358600" is_ac="false">I've been going to The
Devonshire quite a lot.</p>
  <p time="360970" is_ac="false">Have to be Devonshire.</p>
  <p time="362290" is_ac="false">The Devonshire.
Yay.</p>
  <p time="364000" is_ac="false">You'll be no stranger to the
fact that we love The Devonshire.</p>
  <p time="366560" is_ac="false">Yes.</p>
  <p time="367080" is_ac="false">Quite simply, poors an amazing
pint of Guinness, best Guinness you're</p>
  <p time="370280" is_ac="false">gonna get, at least in England, from
Dublin, please don't come hunting me.</p>
  <p time="373600" is_ac="false">But it's way, way more than just Guinness.</p>
  <p time="375970" is_ac="false">The food upstairs is fantastic.</p>
  <p time="378040" is_ac="false">Oisin Rogers, best publican ever, from The
Guinea, again, another great Guinness pub.</p>
  <p time="382520" is_ac="false">Was there for seven years as manager.</p>
  <p time="383970" is_ac="false">This is his own place.</p>
  <p time="385480" is_ac="false">The smell is starting to become
nostalgic to me, which is worrying.</p>
  <p time="389850" is_ac="false">This place has only been open three months</p>
  <p time="392210" is_ac="false">and I walk in and I'm
like, ah, I'm home, baby.</p>
  <p time="397280" is_ac="false">These are killer few things to start.</p>
  <p time="399240" is_ac="false">So, yeah, these nice chunky lardons and</p>
  <p time="401030" is_ac="false">the buttery scallops, it's
got a beautiful crunchy crumb.</p>
  <p time="404290" is_ac="false">This is the brawn toast.</p>
  <p time="405530" is_ac="false">And these are little pork ribs served with</p>
  <p time="407860" is_ac="false">a bit of embers, just to get that
extra smoky flavour up your schnoz.</p>
  <p time="411280" is_ac="false">Yes, the Guinness is fantastic and so are
the toasties and the steak sandwich and</p>
  <p time="414720" is_ac="false">the scotch egg and sausage
just downstairs in the bar.</p>
  <p time="417120" is_ac="false">And that's worth the trip alone.</p>
  <p time="418410" is_ac="false">But upstairs they're cooking on oak,
cooking on the embers and doing incredible</p>
  <p time="423650" is_ac="false">meat dishes and little
beautiful side plates like this.</p>
  <p time="426770" is_ac="false">Oh, my God.</p>
  <p time="428250" is_ac="false">That cut, that fat content.</p>
  <p time="430440" is_ac="false">We also don't have, like, real estate
for plates, so we're just raw dogging it.</p>
  <p time="434250" is_ac="false">Look, it's not easy to get a
table, but it is worth the fight.</p>
  <p time="438730" is_ac="false">In my opinion Bar Crispin, in our</p>
  <p time="440920" is_ac="false">interviews, comes up a
shockingly small amount.</p>
  <p time="443880" is_ac="false">Right.
I love this place.</p>
  <p time="445770" is_ac="false">It could be my most underrated in London.</p>
  <p time="448200" is_ac="false">Could maybe even be a contender
for my best restaurant in London.</p>
  <p time="450920" is_ac="false">Big on their wines and
their natural wines.</p>
  <p time="453040" is_ac="false">If you come as a four, just order</p>
  <p time="454920" is_ac="false">everything and then reload on
whatever you like the most.</p>
  <p time="458120" is_ac="false">It is tiny in there.</p>
  <p time="459040" is_ac="false">It's 14 seats, so we don't have enough
room for our four person crew, so we're</p>
  <p time="462800" is_ac="false">eating outside, but
fortunately, it's not too cold.</p>
  <p time="465760" is_ac="false">Right there we are
pacing ourselves and all.</p>
  <p time="467530" is_ac="false">Yeah, big balls over there got
a bottle of wine for himself.</p>
  <p time="471690" is_ac="false">Yeah, this is the prawn sando.</p>
  <p time="474290" is_ac="false">This is the prawn sando, dude.
Like, it's.</p>
  <p time="476690" is_ac="false">It's a great little starting dish.</p>
  <p time="478480" is_ac="false">Yeah, Cod's roe on very crispy
sourdough with hazelnut.</p>
  <p time="482290" is_ac="false">This tastes like really
high end bacon frazzles.</p>
  <p time="485480" is_ac="false">We've got smoked aubergine, creme
fraiche, jalapenos, the charred mackerel.</p>
  <p time="490480" is_ac="false">Get a bit of everything.</p>
  <p time="491600" is_ac="false">I mean, mackerel is pretty toilet
fish, do you know what I mean?</p>
  <p time="494250" is_ac="false">But the way they cook that, that sweet,
beautiful char on top,</p>
  <p time="498170" is_ac="false">this gorgeous little number here is
the aged beef tartare on a crumpet.</p>
  <p time="502320" is_ac="false">Everything's just, like,
really well presented.</p>
  <p time="504130" is_ac="false">And the pacing is like this.</p>
  <p time="505560" is_ac="false">They come out one dish at a time.</p>
  <p time="507120" is_ac="false">You eat it, you enjoy it, you move on.</p>
  <p time="508800" is_ac="false">So you almost have, like,
your own little tasting menu.</p>
  <p time="511200" is_ac="false">Oh, man, it's beautiful.</p>
  <p time="512290" is_ac="false">It's like cumin and curry leaf.
That's fantastic.</p>
  <p time="514850" is_ac="false">And then this pork rib, barbecue sauce.
Everything.</p>
  <p time="517800" is_ac="false">Everything they do is just
so goddamn interesting.</p>
  <p time="520040" is_ac="false">Where are we going, bro?
The Four Seasons.</p>
  <p time="523610" is_ac="false">Got a bit more space.</p>
  <p time="524690" is_ac="false">This is the jugi Four Seasons, and
we're here for Pavyllon and Bar Antoine.</p>
  <p time="528850" is_ac="false">On this one floor, you have
Pavyllon and you have Bar Antoine.</p>
  <p time="532280" is_ac="false">Bar Antoine.
You have the cocktails, you have wine.</p>
  <p time="535080" is_ac="false">They do these, like, Japanese bar snacks.</p>
  <p time="537690" is_ac="false">This whole place is a
Yannick Alleno restaurant.</p>
  <p time="540200" is_ac="false">It's got 15 Michelin stars.</p>
  <p time="542050" is_ac="false">It's a hugely successful
and celebrated chef.</p>
  <p time="545200" is_ac="false">This is his first London restaurant.</p>
  <p time="547560" is_ac="false">This is one of my favourites.</p>
  <p time="549010" is_ac="false">There's mezcal vodka, shiso leaf,
and, like, a pineapple reduction.</p>
  <p time="557610" is_ac="false">Oh, yeah.</p>
  <p time="559320" is_ac="false">Ooh, ooh.</p>
  <p time="560970" is_ac="false">Instant saliva, both sides of the mouth.</p>
  <p time="563730" is_ac="false">That is gorgeous.</p>
  <p time="564800" is_ac="false">It's like a really classy whiskey apple.</p>
  <p time="566810" is_ac="false">You're bringing out these cocktails
faster than we can consume them.</p>
  <p time="573240" is_ac="false">They're a little signature
here, cheese souffle.</p>
  <p time="575440" is_ac="false">But on top, they've put their
froie gras, which is tres sexy.</p>
  <p time="581000" is_ac="false">You can't get a more French dish.</p>
  <p time="582530" is_ac="false">100%, 110, maybe.</p>
  <p time="584250" is_ac="false">110% French.</p>
  <p time="585930" is_ac="false">Very Yannick, very gorgeous.</p>
  <p time="589050" is_ac="false">Oh, my goodness.</p>
  <p time="590290" is_ac="false">Beef fillet, pepper crust confit,
salted butter, and a cafe de prix sauce.</p>
  <p time="595050" is_ac="false">That is unreal.</p>
  <p time="596970" is_ac="false">Doesn't get more french than that.</p>
  <p time="598850" is_ac="false">So this right here is the chocolate
souffle with a bit of flambe amaretto at</p>
  <p time="603550" is_ac="false">the table, topped off with some
beautiful vanilla ice cream.</p>
  <p time="606650" is_ac="false">Oh, yikes.</p>
  <p time="608770" is_ac="false">Oh, come on.</p>
  <p time="610810" is_ac="false">It's like getting a...</p>
  <p time="613080" is_ac="false">Like, I need a dark room,
you know, some tissues.</p>
  <p time="615960" is_ac="false">Feel like I was probably a bit dressed
down to be in there, that sort of thing.</p>
  <p time="618560" is_ac="false">I really like that.</p>
  <p time="619650" is_ac="false">We need to have a nighttime hug.</p>
  <p time="623400" is_ac="false">Good morning, mate.</p>
  <p time="624440" is_ac="false">Now I'm here for Pophams, one of the</p>
  <p time="626200" is_ac="false">absolute, undoubtedly
best bakeries in London.</p>
  <p time="629770" is_ac="false">Best bakery Pophams, for sure, mate.
Yeah.</p>
  <p time="632000" is_ac="false">You know, Pophams.
Pophams bakery.</p>
  <p time="633650" is_ac="false">Pophams.
Pophams.</p>
  <p time="634920" is_ac="false">Just like the best time.</p>
  <p time="635960" is_ac="false">This is their London field site.</p>
  <p time="637410" is_ac="false">Doubles up in the evening
as a pasta restaurant, but.</p>
  <p time="640170" is_ac="false">Oh, my God.</p>
  <p time="641560" is_ac="false">Started about seven years ago by
the croissant whisperer Ollie Gold.</p>
  <p time="646080" is_ac="false">When and why did you start Pophams?
When?</p>
  <p time="648250" is_ac="false">October 2017.</p>
  <p time="649720" is_ac="false">On the basic premise of trying to be more</p>
  <p time="651760" is_ac="false">innovative and creative
with croissant dough.</p>
  <p time="653960" is_ac="false">You cant go wrong with like anything</p>
  <p time="655690" is_ac="false">really on their pastry team sheet like
these guys Schlossberger,</p>
  <p time="660650" is_ac="false">Schlossberg, Schlossberger
cheese, spring onion and marmite.</p>
  <p time="665130" is_ac="false">Oh hello.
Then we have this guy maple and bacon.</p>
  <p time="668760" is_ac="false">It's not little bacon bits it's just</p>
  <p time="670370" is_ac="false">actually quite thick cut bacon just
wrapped around and this their apple</p>
  <p time="674130" is_ac="false">crumble paired with Ozone
coffee expertly made.</p>
  <p time="677530" is_ac="false">It's so good.</p>
  <p time="678520" is_ac="false">If someone's visiting London and they
pop into Pophams, what should they get?</p>
  <p time="682330" is_ac="false">Essential order, black americano.</p>
  <p time="684360" is_ac="false">And then I would probably go
with this guy, cardamom bun.</p>
  <p time="687080" is_ac="false">Go and give it a tear.</p>
  <p time="688850" is_ac="false">So nice and gooey on the inside
and then you crunch into the top.</p>
  <p time="693490" is_ac="false">That was magnificent mate.</p>
  <p time="695050" is_ac="false">Now Pophams don't do wholesale.</p>
  <p time="697080" is_ac="false">Pophams only serve pastries in Pophams
so they're baking at like six, seven am.</p>
  <p time="702130" is_ac="false">So super duper fresh when
you're having it at 09:00 a.</p>
  <p time="704830" is_ac="false">m or 03:00 p.
m.</p>
  <p time="706000" is_ac="false">It hasn't been baked the day before and
that's important because that's where that</p>
  <p time="709410" is_ac="false">beautiful light,
unbelievable bake comes from.</p>
  <p time="713890" is_ac="false">Honestly I'd give anything to be here.</p>
  <p time="716490" is_ac="false">Old Compton street in the 60s from what
I've heard from people who were around</p>
  <p time="720490" is_ac="false">here at that time it was
basically a 24/7 party here.</p>
  <p time="723440" is_ac="false">Yeah.</p>
  <p time="723850" is_ac="false">And a few iconic spots remain who are
still flying the flag for what once was</p>
  <p time="728130" is_ac="false">like French House, Bar
Termini, Bar Italia.</p>
  <p time="730890" is_ac="false">But there is one place that long
predates those Algerian Coffee Stores.</p>
  <p time="734870" is_ac="false">Now this place has been here since 1887.</p>
  <p time="737170" is_ac="false">This shop's been the same ownership
since the forties dynamic sister duo.</p>
  <p time="740890" is_ac="false">So you have Marissa and Daniela.</p>
  <p time="743080" is_ac="false">Come on, come on.</p>
  <p time="744800" is_ac="false">You've worked it basically
your entire life.</p>
  <p time="746570" is_ac="false">I started when I couldn't see over the
counter and I had to have a little step so</p>
  <p time="750690" is_ac="false">I could use a till and
put things in the grinder.</p>
  <p time="753200" is_ac="false">Child labour.
Don't worry about it.</p>
  <p time="754360" is_ac="false">Yeah, I think I got paid in chocolate.</p>
  <p time="755600" is_ac="false">Oh my treats go to
McDonald's on the corner.</p>
  <p time="757410" is_ac="false">Oh nice.</p>
  <p time="759600" is_ac="false">Over 80 coffees and 120 teas are
served from this little busy shop.</p>
  <p time="764160" is_ac="false">And what I really like is they're serving</p>
  <p time="765570" is_ac="false">coffees that are not
from the known growers.</p>
  <p time="768650" is_ac="false">They have like Australian coffee,
Malawi, Thai coffee, Vietnamese coffee.</p>
  <p time="773640" is_ac="false">This is one of those places that will</p>
  <p time="774890" is_ac="false">serve you a really high
quality espresso for £1.</p>
  <p time="777600" is_ac="false">20.</p>
  <p time="778490" is_ac="false">Little authentic original shops like
this in London are few and far between.</p>
  <p time="782690" is_ac="false">So I think it's really important that us</p>
  <p time="785070" is_ac="false">as we're here is to support
businesses like this.</p>
  <p time="788770" is_ac="false">Luke Hunns, Head Chef at Chilton
Firehouse, who we love dearly.</p>
  <p time="792010" is_ac="false">So his best burger in London was Manna,
like an American smash style burger.</p>
  <p time="796010" is_ac="false">And one of the places to
get those is an Arcade.</p>
  <p time="798760" is_ac="false">There are a few food rules like this in</p>
  <p time="800440" is_ac="false">London, but this is like
quite a well branded juji one.</p>
  <p time="802840" is_ac="false">Home to Manna, where we
want that smash burger.</p>
  <p time="805130" is_ac="false">But you've also got Indian
food, Cantonese, Nepalese.</p>
  <p time="808690" is_ac="false">There really is something for everyone.</p>
  <p time="811570" is_ac="false">This is the double platter.</p>
  <p time="813160" is_ac="false">I'm sure some people take
these down on their own.</p>
  <p time="815050" is_ac="false">Chicken tenders, waffle fries, three</p>
  <p time="817170" is_ac="false">little sauces, and some
gherkins for good measure.</p>
  <p time="820370" is_ac="false">Single patty smash.</p>
  <p time="821850" is_ac="false">Not too too thin.</p>
  <p time="822890" is_ac="false">Loads of gherkins, hot sauce.</p>
  <p time="825610" is_ac="false">Chip dip.</p>
  <p time="826850" is_ac="false">Oh, can we get a slow mo replay on that?</p>
  <p time="831800" is_ac="false">This is the normal Manna smash.</p>
  <p time="834410" is_ac="false">American style mustard pickles.</p>
  <p time="836570" is_ac="false">It's a very enhanced
nostalgic taste, you know.</p>
  <p time="839960" is_ac="false">Manna is one of the eight food vendors on
the ground floor upstairs in little</p>
  <p time="843690" is_ac="false">mezzanine Plaza, home to
some really spicy Thai.</p>
  <p time="847570" is_ac="false">Okay, so Luke Farrell from
Speedboat Bar, this is another one.</p>
  <p time="850690" is_ac="false">It hits this place, right?</p>
  <p time="852490" is_ac="false">It has a Michelin Bib.</p>
  <p time="853650" is_ac="false">It's seriously good food
and a pretty lowfi setting.</p>
  <p time="856240" is_ac="false">Right?</p>
  <p time="856490" is_ac="false">So this is a betel leaf around
the little cashew nut salad.</p>
  <p time="859530" is_ac="false">It's very fragrant, it's very
Thai, and a little bit spice.</p>
  <p time="865360" is_ac="false">How's it going, Krismas?
What are you doing?</p>
  <p time="866760" is_ac="false">What's this?
This one?</p>
  <p time="867810" is_ac="false">Massaman Beef.
Oh, this is your famous.</p>
  <p time="869840" is_ac="false">Yeah.</p>
  <p time="870400" is_ac="false">And it's the only one that people
can order downstairs as well?</p>
  <p time="872720" is_ac="false">Yes.
Without coming here.</p>
  <p time="874040" is_ac="false">Would you like to try one, though?
I have to.</p>
  <p time="875880" is_ac="false">Okay.
Please.</p>
  <p time="876640" is_ac="false">Yeah.
I mean, what I mean is.</p>
  <p time="878080" is_ac="false">Yes, please.
Krismas.</p>
  <p time="880360" is_ac="false">This is a beautiful hot sea bream dish.</p>
  <p time="882970" is_ac="false">We've then got a massaman
curry beef and potato.</p>
  <p time="885530" is_ac="false">They're beautiful, light,
melt in your mouth pork belly.</p>
  <p time="888520" is_ac="false">What's this spicy looking bastard?</p>
  <p time="890000" is_ac="false">This one's the spiciest on their menu.</p>
  <p time="891810" is_ac="false">That is the spiciest menu?</p>
  <p time="894680" is_ac="false">This is a seven spice chicken
curry, I think they call it.</p>
  <p time="897160" is_ac="false">This is some morning glory.</p>
  <p time="898520" is_ac="false">That's gonna help us with the spice.</p>
  <p time="899970" is_ac="false">We've got some fried eggs, some roti,
and of course, some nice fragrant rice.</p>
  <p time="904930" is_ac="false">Unapologetically authentic and original.</p>
  <p time="907520" is_ac="false">And it's just a flavour profile
that you don't get elsewhere.</p>
  <p time="909890" is_ac="false">Oh, no.</p>
  <p time="910930" is_ac="false">You f*cking bastard.</p>
  <p time="916080" is_ac="false">Okay, we're at The Connaught
Bar, now in our interview series.</p>
  <p time="918970" is_ac="false">So many chefs say this is the
best cocktail bar in London.</p>
  <p time="923690" is_ac="false">Best cocktail spot.
The Connaught Bar.</p>
  <p time="925640" is_ac="false">Come on.
The Connaught.</p>
  <p time="926720" is_ac="false">I like The Connaught.
Connaught Bar.</p>
  <p time="928000" is_ac="false">It's got everything you want,
I think, Connaught Hotel.</p>
  <p time="930040" is_ac="false">You've got to go down to the Connaught.</p>
  <p time="931570" is_ac="false">The Connaught Bar, I think, is amazing.</p>
  <p time="933680" is_ac="false">And yeah, there are lots of five star
hotels in London with beautiful bars.</p>
  <p time="937130" is_ac="false">What sets this place
out is Giorgio and Ago.</p>
  <p time="940200" is_ac="false">Okay, what are you going to order, mate?
What's going on?</p>
  <p time="942050" is_ac="false">I feel like I should have a
martini because yours are like.</p>
  <p time="945280" is_ac="false">Well, they're like mythological, you know?</p>
  <p time="946690" is_ac="false">I'd rather say iconic,
but mythological will do.</p>
  <p time="949410" is_ac="false">Yeah, it's a real.</p>
  <p time="953440" is_ac="false">Every martini at The
Connaught Bar is special.</p>
  <p time="956170" is_ac="false">We stir our very own
Connaught gin 75 millilitre.</p>
  <p time="960970" is_ac="false">And then we have a blend of three</p>
  <p time="963290" is_ac="false">different dru vermouth  to add
dryness as well as complexity.</p>
  <p time="967650" is_ac="false">We have a selection of five
different bitter essences.</p>
  <p time="970930" is_ac="false">We paint the glass with our bitter.</p>
  <p time="973930" is_ac="false">Don't forget to smile.</p>
  <p time="975930" is_ac="false">Look at that.</p>
  <p time="978840" is_ac="false">What the hell was that?</p>
  <p time="981130" is_ac="false">I've got skills.</p>
  <p time="982290" is_ac="false">I've chosen my bitters.</p>
  <p time="983770" is_ac="false">I went for Tonka, a
mouthy lemon and an olive.</p>
  <p time="986680" is_ac="false">Cause I'm special, apparently.</p>
  <p time="988170" is_ac="false">That's smooth, baby.
That is.</p>
  <p time="990240" is_ac="false">I mean, it doesn't really taste like
you're drinking completely neat booze.</p>
  <p time="992840" is_ac="false">It's a.</p>
  <p time="993330" is_ac="false">It's a refined and elegant
cocktail, my friend.</p>
  <p time="996290" is_ac="false">I've been told.</p>
  <p time="997890" is_ac="false">So magnetum is the
marriage of two elements.</p>
  <p time="1001570" is_ac="false">We have a clarified milk punch on the</p>
  <p time="1003710" is_ac="false">bottom based on dry sherry,
lavender, lemon verbena on top.</p>
  <p time="1008490" is_ac="false">We have scotch whiskey
together with sweet sherry.</p>
  <p time="1011330" is_ac="false">So this is a magnetum.</p>
  <p time="1012650" is_ac="false">I'm about to drink it in
the world's fifth best bar.</p>
  <p time="1015610" is_ac="false">Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p time="1017400" is_ac="false">I could have that on intravenous drip.</p>
  <p time="1018880" is_ac="false">I think there's a lot of booze in there</p>
  <p time="1020650" is_ac="false">and it tastes like a
lovely, beautiful meadow.</p>
  <p time="1023330" is_ac="false">Oh, that's so good, that one.</p>
  <p time="1025730" is_ac="false">That's brilliant.
Okay.</p>
  <p time="1028170" is_ac="false">Carnaby street.</p>
  <p time="1029250" is_ac="false">Super central, super touristy.</p>
  <p time="1031160" is_ac="false">But there's a little thing
here called Kingly Court.</p>
  <p time="1033210" is_ac="false">All food places.</p>
  <p time="1034400" is_ac="false">Most people just hit the ground floor, but</p>
  <p time="1036510" is_ac="false">right here in Donia, beautiful
Filipino home cooking.</p>
  <p time="1040320" is_ac="false">The other very gorgeous Florence Mae.</p>
  <p time="1042040" is_ac="false">This is her restaurant.</p>
  <p time="1043120" is_ac="false">It's just flavour profiles that
I haven't had anywhere else.</p>
  <p time="1045760" is_ac="false">That's all I'm gonna say.</p>
  <p time="1046840" is_ac="false">This is their signature
cocktail, the pepino.</p>
  <p time="1049530" is_ac="false">Oh, that's good.
Gin, lime, cucumber and coconut serum.</p>
  <p time="1053800" is_ac="false">About time we had a cocktail.</p>
  <p time="1055360" is_ac="false">This is their prawn and pork dumplings.</p>
  <p time="1057410" is_ac="false">White crab on top in a brown butter sauce.</p>
  <p time="1060450" is_ac="false">Oh, you didn't see nothing.</p>
  <p time="1062250" is_ac="false">You didn't see nothing.</p>
  <p time="1064010" is_ac="false">Love that.</p>
  <p time="1065280" is_ac="false">Let's go for some sea bream ceviche with</p>
  <p time="1067680" is_ac="false">avocado cream and chive
oil and a bit of chilli.</p>
  <p time="1070000" is_ac="false">Oh, I can't wait to get involved.</p>
  <p time="1071530" is_ac="false">So this is the turbot Bicol express.</p>
  <p time="1073560" is_ac="false">Bicol is a region of the Philippines, and</p>
  <p time="1075830" is_ac="false">it's like a known spicy
coconut creamy sauce.</p>
  <p time="1080080" is_ac="false">And again, this is pork lechon.
Oh, my goodness.</p>
  <p time="1082800" is_ac="false">In, like, a liver peppercorn sauce.</p>
  <p time="1084720" is_ac="false">Go and look at the state of this lobster.</p>
  <p time="1086770" is_ac="false">Yeah, butternut squash, coconut.
Hello.</p>
  <p time="1090930" is_ac="false">Cheers, bro.
Let's go for it.</p>
  <p time="1092800" is_ac="false">Ube choux.</p>
  <p time="1094120" is_ac="false">This is a choux pastry.</p>
  <p time="1095490" is_ac="false">In it is ube ice cream.</p>
  <p time="1097450" is_ac="false">Ube is this sweet potato.</p>
  <p time="1099250" is_ac="false">Very popular Filipino dessert.</p>
  <p time="1101080" is_ac="false">Donia, you're brilliant.</p>
  <p time="1103280" is_ac="false">Really like you and your ube choux.</p>
  <p time="1106840" is_ac="false">For our final stop of tonight and this
film and it's wonderful journey, we're</p>
  <p time="1111280" is_ac="false">checking into our beloved
cocktail bar, SOMA.</p>
  <p time="1114530" is_ac="false">Okay, so upstairs is Kricket,
an Indian restaurant.</p>
  <p time="1117600" is_ac="false">One of Will's absolute faves down here.</p>
  <p time="1119600" is_ac="false">This is their, like,
speakeasy cocktail bar.</p>
  <p time="1121690" is_ac="false">Their cocktail menu does have
also that Indian influence.</p>
  <p time="1125210" is_ac="false">So we've ordered a turmeric
cocktail with sesame oil.</p>
  <p time="1128040" is_ac="false">And we're going for a Chaat,
which is like an Indian margarita.</p>
