  <p time="240" is_ac="false">Welcome to London, a city known for its diverse 
food scene that is a melting pot of cultures  </p>
  <p time="6060" is_ac="false">and flavors from all around the world. whether 
you're foodie or simply someone who loves good  </p>
  <p time="10980" is_ac="false">food you're in for a treat because in this video 
we'll take you on a culinary journey through this  </p>
  <p time="15540" is_ac="false">city showing you the best locations for 
breakfast lunch and dinner. so sit back  </p>
  <p time="20520" is_ac="false">relax and get ready to tantalize your taste 
buds with the best food London has to offer  </p>
  <p time="25980" is_ac="false">we're starting off with breakfast. the first 
breakfast tip is The Breakfast Club. they have  </p>
  <p time="31080" is_ac="false">multiple locations all over the city. we had the 
best eggs benedict that we've ever had and they  </p>
  <p time="36420" is_ac="false">had so many more other options. second 
breakfast tip is "where the pancakes are"  </p>
  <p time="42180" is_ac="false">located in the area called Southwark. they have 
English breakfast pancakes that are to die for  </p>
  <p time="49440" is_ac="false">and they have so many vegan options as well if 
that is your thing. so here on STUFR we stuff  </p>
  <p time="55920" is_ac="false">our faces with the best food all over the world so 
subscribe right now so you won't miss any of our  </p>
  <p time="61440" is_ac="false">upcoming food adventures. and now let's move on to 
lunch in London. First option go to Borough Market.  </p>
  <p time="69120" is_ac="false">this is a food market that is foodie heaven 
first of all check out the famous Ginger Pig  </p>
  <p time="76980" is_ac="false">sausage rolls. I'm having a traditional sausage 
roll from the Ginger Pig here at Borough Market  </p>
  <p time="85440" is_ac="false">it's a really large chunk of meat but it's good. 
then check out the hot cross buns which are a  </p>
  <p time="91800" is_ac="false">traditional warm bun with raisins and cinnamon 
and it's really good [Music] refresh really soft  </p>
  <p time="99720" is_ac="false">really fluffy also sticky also a little sour. I 
think there's a lot of orange in there as well  </p>
  <p time="109800" is_ac="false">wow never had something like this before.
at the same shop they also have great donut  </p>
  <p time="115020" is_ac="false">options. I'm having a donut, a salted 
caramel donut with honeycomb on top  </p>
  <p time="120960" is_ac="false">and this is so good it has so much 
filling inside and it's really awesome</p>
  <p time="134880" is_ac="false">um</p>
  <p time="142580" is_ac="false">[Music]  </p>
  <p time="143580" is_ac="false">and don't forget about all the amazing fudge  </p>
  <p time="145800" is_ac="false">that they sell on Borough market 
so many flavors so many options</p>
  <p time="148980" is_ac="false">there are rainbow Bagels, there are sandwiches 
with pulled pork that will make your mouth water</p>
  <p time="163200" is_ac="false">if you are in the Covent Garden area then check 
out Ben's cookies, freshly baked cookies on the  </p>
  <p time="174240" is_ac="false">spot. crunchy outside gooey inside. it was really 
good. we had the ginger and dark chocolate option  </p>
  <p time="182340" is_ac="false">and of course if you're in London you need 
to have an afternoon tea so just head over  </p>
  <p time="186660" is_ac="false">into one of the pubs and order yourself a really 
nice English tea with milk. you'll love it well  </p>
  <p time="192660" is_ac="false">then it's time for dinner right so if you are in 
the pub having tea then maybe just stick around  </p>
  <p time="197700" is_ac="false">for dinner because a pub has so much really good 
local and traditional British food. for instance  </p>
  <p time="204720" is_ac="false">an amazing steak in ale pie with veggies and 
mashed potatoes or what about a shepherd's  </p>
  <p time="210060" is_ac="false">pie. for this you can just go to any Pub you'll 
see. but then we have another good option Street  </p>
  <p time="217680" is_ac="false">Burger by Gordon Ramsay the famous Gordon Ramsay 
and he has a few Street burger restaurants all  </p>
  <p time="223740" is_ac="false">over the city and their burgers are so fresh 
and so tasty. you can also have some fries on  </p>
  <p time="231060" is_ac="false">the side but be careful with the hot as 
hell fries because they are really really  </p>
  <p time="234660" is_ac="false">hot. and if you're there check out their amazing 
sticky toffee pudding. it is our new addiction</p>
  <p time="244380" is_ac="false">then if you're there for multiple nights you 
really want to head into a Indian restaurant  </p>
  <p time="252060" is_ac="false">because Indian food is huge in London and we 
have a secret tip for you because the India  </p>
  <p time="258660" is_ac="false">Club is a secret hidden local restaurant 
that only local Londoners go to because  </p>
  <p time="264180" is_ac="false">you won't see that it's a restaurant 
on the outside there's just a little  </p>
  <p time="267480" is_ac="false">chalkboard. you go into a stairway and then 
on the second floor is the restaurant it's  </p>
  <p time="272280" is_ac="false">a tiny simple restaurant not much decor 
but the food and the flavors are amazing  </p>
  <p time="278820" is_ac="false">it's also amazing we just found the hidden Indian 
restaurant in London and it's really like super  </p>
  <p time="285060" is_ac="false">simple looks like a kind of living living 
room canteen kind of setting but the food</p>
  <p time="292320" is_ac="false">mind blowing. if you're in London you must go here 
but it's really hard to get a table we were lucky  </p>
  <p time="297660" is_ac="false">so come early to get a table they don't have 
to have many tables so you're in for a treat. </p>
  <p time="303840" is_ac="false">It's amazing. If you're into some Japanese food 
then go to Soryu Ramen. there we had amazing  </p>
  <p time="311880" is_ac="false">Ramen really good gyoza and some other Japanese 
snacks. if you want to have a great steak dinner  </p>
  <p time="321180" is_ac="false">then go to Blacklock Steakhouse in SoHo. their 
steaks are really superb quality and definitely  </p>
  <p time="329340" is_ac="false">check out their dessert menu because the white 
chocolate cheesecake is heaven it was so lush. </p>
  <p time="335940" is_ac="false">and they come with a big bowl and they scoop on 
your plate and you can say when it's enough. it was  </p>
  <p time="342540" is_ac="false">just really good. after dinner you might want to 
go and have a nice cocktail right because you're  </p>
  <p time="349380" is_ac="false">in London you want to celebrate then check out 
Cahoots cocktails in SoHo. their cocktail menu is  </p>
  <p time="356640" is_ac="false">really extensive and especially the serving staff 
is so funny and authentic. you'll have a great  </p>
  <p time="361560" is_ac="false">time [Music] so after all that food and Cocktails 
if you still want a midnight snack then head over  </p>
  <p time="370860" is_ac="false">to Chinatown and maybe try a fresh egg tart over 
there or any other tiny little Chinese snack</p>
  <p time="379140" is_ac="false">when you're in the UK you have to get a chocolate orange, these are amazing chocolate with  </p>
  <p time="385860" is_ac="false">orange and you have to smash them to open 
it and it feels like a orange but actually  </p>
  <p time="389580" is_ac="false">we don't need the chocolate orange today 
because we already have like 10 or 12 of  </p>
  <p time="394140" is_ac="false">those at home. okay we went and splurged. we 
were at Harrods and we splurged. we paid nine  </p>
  <p time="399720" is_ac="false">pounds for a little pistachio raspberry tart. 
it looks awesome it has the Harrods logo on it  </p>
  <p time="407220" is_ac="false">which I should eat first. Maybe. it looks gorgeous 
this is like really haute-patisserie, I would call  </p>
  <p time="413580" is_ac="false">I hope at least I hope the flavors are 
as amazing as it looks I'm gonna dig it</p>
  <p time="422880" is_ac="false">all the pistachio that's like a whole 
pistachio filling it's like a sort of  </p>
  <p time="426780" is_ac="false">like a cupcake but it's chocolate outside and it 
has a really like squishy pistachio filling inside  </p>
  <p time="433380" is_ac="false">and then there's more raspberry inside 
I do have to say this is very special  </p>
  <p time="439200" is_ac="false">I wouldn't say it's worth nine pounds maybe but 
it's really awesome the flavors are really good  </p>
  <p time="445140" is_ac="false">and it's nice to treat yourself 
sometimes and the cameraman is  </p>
  <p time="447960" is_ac="false">saying my mouth is covered in everything 
I don't care I'm enjoying this </p>
  <p time="457920" is_ac="false">yes and I think that's about it for a full days of 
food in London well check out the description box  </p>
  <p time="467160" is_ac="false">for all the details all the links to the places 
that we mentioned in this video and needless to  </p>
