Okay, lovely Alfresco dining.
Beautiful, between all the gas 
and the pollution of the cars...
For the next stop on our 
neverending crescendo of a trip,
We convinced Lord Z to show us 
some real Italian fast food.
Take the sandwich!
He couldn’t have been more excited.
He does not want to be in here for long.
It's like seeing a fish out of water.
Get in, get out.
There is no wine cellar.
Not enjoying.
Therefore, Z doesn't know what to do.
Cheers guys!
Italy.
To Italian fast food.
We are at the side of a highway.
Yeah.
At Autogrill.
In Italian it's called Autogrill.
"Autogrill".
So what do we have first?
This looks good!
Actually it's not bad.
That looks almost as good as the one we had in…
- Don't say stuff like that.
 - Okay, okay, sorry.
I said almost. I said almost.
Obviously not. I mean it's not 
going to taste as good, I know that.
Look at the colour.
It's our first ciabatta bread in Italy.
It's only to show the mozzarella, 
so they only put it outside.
Ohhhh. That's cheeky.
And also what is this?
What is that?
The world's saddest piece of salad.
What do you call this?
Ciabatta with prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella.
Okay.
Okay. I don't know about 
buffalo mozzarella, but...
- Yeah?
 - It is not bad.
Yeah!
Not bad at all.
Better than McDonald's.
It's way better than McDonald's.
If they sold that near our office...
You would get them.
Occasionally I'd get it.
- Yeah.
 - If I was in a hurry.
I'd get it all the time!
That actually looks good.
Yeah. And then you open it...
There's a whole tomato in there.
Okay.
Wow.
- There's a hole in the bread!
 - There's a hole!
It’s like when you open a crisp 
packet and it's mostly empty!
So this is called a Milanese. Is this 
like a traditional Milan sandwich?
I guess.
Okay. That is horrible.
It's breaded chicken, how bad can it be? In a roll?
That is horrible.
No. What is that sound?
Oh, crusty bread?
Even by English standards, 
that's genuinely like...
An abomination.
I couldn't eat it I'm sorry.
He's actually been quite respectful to the food.
I've been very respectful.
What is this one?
Focaccia.
Looks like there's a little 
bit of pistachio in here.
It's not bad. It's not bad.
Mozzarella cheese again?
Yeah. It's not bad, right?
If you come to Autogrill, you 
need to know what to order.
Yes, of course.
Stay the heck away from the milanese.
This you can.
This is fine.
This you can.
- This is good.
 - Yeah.
That's actually good.
It's herby.
What is that in there? Garlic?
I actually want more of that.
That is actually delicious.
That’s good.
I mean, it's not fancy at all.
This has one slice of mortadella. That's it.
There's a hair in there. I'm 
not going to eat it. I'm sorry.
No, are you serious?
Oh yeah, that's a hair.
It's okay. Look, Italian hair.

And now back to the video.
There's a hair in there.
I'm not going to eat it. I'm sorry.
No, are you serious?
Oh yeah, that's a hair.
Look, Italian hair.
Now this looks good.
I feel like this is what I'm most excited about.
Soft cheese, ham, and is that mortadella?
It is mortadella.
Smoked ham.
And pistachio.
The bread looks great.
How is that?
It's warm.
Not bad?
I like it.
Which is better: this, this or this?
This is my favourite.
- Amazing.
 - This is definitely my favourite.
This is fresher. Lighter.
Yeah, it's fresh. It tastes fresh.
Amazing.
So somebody from the camera team got a pizza.
Oh, wow.
- Can we please take it through?
 - Luke you ordered a pizza?
Oh dear.
Something that I don't even know.
What is this? Is it pepperoni?
- That looks like a Tesco's basic pizza.
 - Look how dry it is.
It just looks like pizza to me.
No, no.
It just looks like pizza.
That looks like one of the worst 
looking pizzas I've ever seen.
And you ate it Luke. Was it good?
- Yeah.
- No...
Now this does feel like an insult to 
Italy. We're in Italy. You can't eat that.
Oh, it's actually softer than I expected.
I thought it was going to be hard.
Actually not bad.
No…
No, this is bad.
No, it's good.
It's not pizza dough.
The dough is something different.
Similar to ciabatta.
I think it's fine.
So Ducky's chowing down on our leftover Milanese.
That's the worst one Ducky. Have this!
I like it.
Have this one. Have this one. This 
one's better. This one's a lot better.
It really does. It really does.
That is terrible. You can't come to Italy 
and have that as the only pizza you have.
Tonight I'm going to take you to some pizza.
What do you think?
Real pizza. Real pizza.
I don't think it's going to 
get much better than this.
You're an idiot. You're an absolute idiot.
Finale.
 That looks good.
Sfogliatella.
That looks very good.
You know where they invented it?
In Naples. Season two…
This is custard.
Should be ricotta.
I thought it was just going to be like 
pastry all the way through like a croissant.
No!
It’s cream.
It's ricotta.
Ricotta cheese on the inside!
With orange?
Yeah.
Look at the layers of pastry though. That 
to me says like a high quality pastry.
It's not like a fast food pastry.
You're not going to believe 
this, but this is frozen.
So imagine how the fresh one tastes.
I like this. Don't get me wrong.
That's a frozen one?
Yeah. I like it.
That's the best thing we’ve had.
That is good.
Ducky, try that dessert.
Listen to the sound. The sound is crisp.
There’s one last element that I want you guys to try.
Oh, what's that?
So when Italians are in a rush and you're 
like, oh my God, there's nowhere to stop.
I'm kilometres away.
Yeah?
They take out a pocket coffee.
What the hell is a pocket coffee?
It looks like a ketchup sachet.
You're having us on. This can't be a thing.
No way.
Are you kidding?
No way.
It's like an Italian banana milk.
That's it. So if you're in the countryside, 
and you need some coffee… drink this.
Why is it so mini?
Why does it look like one of those little 
miniature foods.
Made for a miniature food channel on YouTube?
That’s it, done.
That is very sugary.
Done.
Did you just down it?
That's it.
It's just chocolate.
It just chocolate and coffee.
That's pretty good.
It's very sweet.
Crazy fast energy.
So it has to be super sweet.
Extremely strong flavour.
It's lovely. I like that!
Is it?
Yeah.
Yeah. I would eat that.
Yeah!
All right.
Well, Auto Grill. I don't 
know what I was expecting.
It probably lived down to my expectations.
What time is it?
Let's see if we can grab some McDonalds I guess.
He's livid.
He's walked away.
He's absolutely livid.
He's literally walking off.
He's literally gone.
Ciao!
He likes your Instagram.
He's got a fan!
He knows you!
You've met your first fan!
In Italy.
Ciao.
Lord Z!
I don't think I've ever seen 
Z looking bashful before.
He absolutely loves it.
Of all the places that 
we've been to though, Mr. Z.
How embarrassing. How embarrassing that it's here!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have pizza tonight.
Finally.
Carbonara pizza...?
Oh my gosh!
What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh my gosh.
Oh, Ollie.!
Why and how is this on the menu?
The thing is, it looks, I 
think it looks incredible.
Sorry guys.
We have arrived. The journey is complete.
