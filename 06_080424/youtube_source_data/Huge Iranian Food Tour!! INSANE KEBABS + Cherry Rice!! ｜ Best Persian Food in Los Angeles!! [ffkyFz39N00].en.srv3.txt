and operated restaurants back home in
tehran
before coming to the united states and
when they came to the united states
mr rafi did a variety of jobs he did
some plumbing but eventually they opened
a small little restaurant called raffi's
place which started out with four tables
and it's grown because of their
hospitality because of their
friendliness because of their incredibly
delicious food it's grown into what it
is today raffi's place is one of the
