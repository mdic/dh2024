 A celebrity chef is who makes good food 
and also makes people too.
crazy about himself. 
But mostly in India we know those chefs 
whom we watch on TV or on the internet.
So I thought why not make a video on those chefs
 who has brought recognition 
to Indian food across the world.
But the public has not been able to
 give him that much respect.
By the way, in the previous video
 I have exposed some of your favorite Chefs.
So go watch that video but after it.
Today I have found out the name of the celebrity chef
 who taught us the legit method 
of adding salt to vegetables.
 Let's add salt-walt.
Who are the fans of Salt-walt. 
Please  post in the comment section.
Till then let me take you to 
Chef Harpal Singh Sokhi's wonderful 
 classic restaurant Karigari
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
The mark of a real chef is that
 even the chandeliers in its restaurant 
were made of spoons.
Tell you the most interesting thing about the menu 
that there is a story hidden behind every dish.
Which is based on the different experiences of Chef.
Have you heard the name of the show Khana Khazana?
The first episode was not hosted 
by Sanjeev Kapoor but hosted by him.
After that Sanjeev Kapoor took all the limelight
 and this poor guy remained underrated.
Sad life.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
The first dish we have ordered is Chit Karare.
 Chef Harpal tells that there is a station named Patti, 
 30 kilometers away from Jalandhar, 
where a Chit Karare seller sits.
And he knows how to call people 
whether they want 100 or thousand. 
Meaning, need 100 number spicy or thousand number spicy.
You think I will be able to tolerate the maximum
Yes sir!
Let's start with maximum
[ Crunch ]
What happened? Why are there tears in your eyes?
Have I ever been scared?
 I have never been scared till date.
Are you doing comedy?
Now Checking mild ones.
This is nice.
Well honestly  this dish is very tasty.
 Basically it's is fried potato.
 Thin chips made of potatoes 
and is topped with spicy chutney.
I am enjoying it.
 I have never been scared till date.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
 People from Pakistan had commented last time that
Butter is not added to the original chicken sajji.
Butter is not added to them.
[ Crunch ]
Preparation of chicken with very whole spices
with Kulcha Bread.
The taste and combination looks amazing, man.
Let's try the coconut drink.
[ Slurp ]
Oh My God!
Very different, very distinguish.
very differential
Tell me more 4-5 words.
It's different, understand.
You will get to eat three types of mushrooms 
for the price of one mushroom
Button mushroom, Shitake mushroom 
and Guchchci mushroom and two types of gravy.
How has it turned black, has it burnt?
No, charcoal powder is added.
[ Crunch ]
 Honestly speaking, 
I have been to many Chef's restaurants 
and eaten different types of food.
But the taste at this Chef's restaurant is amazing. 
My personal recommendation is that you come and eat
and if you don't enjoy then hit me with two shoes.
Brother, let's end today's review with the dessert, 
its name is 'Shahi Tukda Gulab Jamun'.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
It's a perfect restaurant.
The taste of every thing is very exceptional
And according to me, Chef Harpal and his restaurant 
is very underrated and they should be recognized.
You must come.
So let me show you the next 
underrated celebrity chef restaurant.
Rahul, How much we call Vikas Khanna 
or Sanjeev Kapoor  as India's No. 1 chef.
But the real experts of food industry. 
And in the eyes of media outlets like Hindustan Time,
Do you know who is actually is India's No.1 Chef?
 Bro, He is the executive Chef
 of India's no.1  restaurant Indian Accent.
Chef Manish Mehrotra.
This is Manish Mehrotra's restaurant
Comorin.
Within a few months of its launch, 
it has reached number 69 in the list 
of Asia's best restaurants.
I know you love the number. 
You're  going to love this place too.
Let's go.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
If you will see his award section,
Zomato Best Restaurants award,
Icons Whisky awards.
I don't understand why their restaurant 
has received so many awards 
and yet it remains so underrated.
I am unable to understand.
In my eyes he is not a Chef, he is the Chef.
Thanks!!
If you will see the names of his dishes
like, Lemon Gun Powder Idli
Sweet-corn Khichdi
Means our traditional dishes has been presented here 
with a model fusion and a modern touch. 
This is Gun Powder Idli and its price is â‚¹ 500.
This place is situated at Gold Golf Course road, Gurgaon.
  And these prices are very common here.
[ Crunch ]
Oho! It should have had so much salt in it. 
A few moments later.
When we told him about the salt issue,
 he re-prepare this dish for us 
and also we got a complimentary dish.
Fried Chicken Burger.
Sometimes I feel like lying to take advantage
 but today it was an honest case.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Now things are being tasted, 
spices are being understood. 
Earlier the taste of salt was dominating a bit.
Yes! You can say the dish fancy.
It's a fusion, get to experience something new.
Has anything of him is ever bad?
[ Crunch ]
This is very oily, but very tasty.
This is Murgh Yakhni Pulav. 
You can never see Biryani of this colour.
In fact, the pieces inside it are also quite different.
 It's kind of Kashmiri Biryani.
Today is our lucky day.
Since the complaint regarding excess salt was lodged
 by the women behind the camera
 Since then the complimentary thing has not stopped.
This is my charm. (wifey)
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Usually biryani is spicy 
but this is not at all like that.
Guchchi Mushroom Biryani
I think both rice and preparation is same,
 there is chicken in the middle, 
and here is mushroom in the middle.
It's same.
Do you know which mushroom is it?
 Mushroom Googly Dim-Sum, 
which we had eaten at Viraat Kohli's restaurant
Brother I would definitely recommend it,
 must check it out. 
Until then let me check out 
the next underrated celebrity Chef's restaurant
Rahul, did you knew that
 India's number one Chef Sanjeev Kapoor 
or his any restaurant has not yet received 
any Michelin Star Award. 
[ Baby cry ]
But it is with this member of our list 
whose restaurant I have brought you
 and he does not have only one award,
but he has two Michelin Star awards.
 He is the Big Daddy of the cooking industry.
OG  Atul Kochhar
This is Atul Kochhar's lavish  restaurant 'SAGA'
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
How many languages in the world?
 7,000
And this restaurant is calling us poor in every language
 You are.
Brother, I have never seen such a lavish 
& luxurious restaurant in my life.
Do you know what is here?
Chidiya Samosa worth â‚¹ 600
Chicken momos worth â‚¹750.
Very nice.
A Sikandari Raan of â‚¹3,500  is also available here.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Rahul, do you know where we are eating samosa today?
What kind of place? 
A normal man does not eat samosa here. 
Aman Gupta lives here in DLF Camellias
where the flats are worth 100 crores.
Even samosas would never have thought 
that I could look so beautiful.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Honestly speaking, the chole along with it is such 
that one feels like eating it again and again, 
but the samosa is not such tasty.
In a Dish whose name is Samosa,
 if Samosa is not tasty then it is not fun.
I agree that your restaurant is
 at a very expensive place, it is on Golf Course Road, 
Will you sell four momos worth Rs 750?
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Bro, momos are very nice.
I swear, you can find better ones in the streets.
The name of this dish is Kundan Kali.
It has broccoli inside it along with a gravy
 and multigrain rotis with it.
 It look like as simple bread,
 but when you will hear its price, 
your mangoes too will burst.
Friend, a roti costs â‚¹220
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
From which angle are the rotis worth Rs 220 
and from which angle are the broccoli worth Rs 600?â€‹
I am unable to understand. My God!
This is the hidden gem that needs to stay hidden.
We go to the next underrated celebrity chef's restaurant.
Well, who remembers NDTV's show Traveling Diva?
No one remembers now, move forward.
Ok, that's why in 2012 the chef who hosted 
the show and remains underrated till date.
Guys, the next entry in the list 
is the Italian restaurant Diva
 and the chef Ritu Dalmia who runs it.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
 You know guys, I feel that Ritu ji must have opened
 this restaurant during the day
She forgot to set the lights for night.
No one likes such childish things 
and people make fun of them.
This Gals first opened a restaurant which failed,
 then opened another which she had to leave. 
 Then opened her third restaurant with the name DIVA,
which has been a superhit for the last 23 years. 
Basically the menu here is not North Indian cuisine 
but Italian cuisine.
Ritu ji has learned to make Italian in in Italy only.
So what has come, I didn't even order this.
 It's complimentary.
If I sit in a restaurant for 10 minutes 
with holding the menu
let me eat this item
Hey! you...
I will eat, people will eat or not. 
People are crazy.
People don't know how to collect free stuff.
In reality, amount of bill is not reimburse 
in ordered dishes but in these things
[ Indistinct chattering ]
what is so disgusting about this?
How is the taste?
What will be the taste?  it's of tomato and bread.
I ordered two types of pizza.
Two are combined into one. 
These poor people doesn't eat pizza.
One half is Burrata Cheese 
and the other half is wild mushroom.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
To be honest, I have never eaten such average
 Burrata cheese pizza.
There is a Nomad pizza in Delhi, ever try it.
That is called Pizza.
This is pure garbage.
 This Chef has opened Italian restaurant in India
 and Indian restaurant in Italy. 
But I feel that something has gone
 terribly wrong at both places.
I didn't enjoy it, bro.
 Tiramisu, it's basically a European Dessert.
[ munching ]
Why do these dishes say that you adjust, 
we are like this only.
Where these are made,
 they are according to their taste para.
This restaurant also deserves 
to be underrated in my opinion.
Drink this Italian ice-tea
We don't like it.
Let's move on to next.
Today I have brought you the last restaurant on the list. 
This guy has not just one but 26 restaurants to his name.
In which the quite popular name is FARZI cafe, 
PA PA YA, Masala Bar
This guy himself may not be a professional Chef
But he has judged Chefs in season 5 of MasterChef. 
And this is one of their 26 restaurants. 
Presenting you guys Farzi cafe by Mr. Zorawar Kalra.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Do you know what people used to say his father?
The emperor of the modern cuisine food industry.
The things are very expensive even in his restaurant. 
We taste it and tell you 
whether underrated is right or wrong.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Oh My God! This dish is very good.
It has very unique flavour.
ðŸŽµ Music ðŸŽµ
Oh My God!
Brother, food is amazing.
Brother, the shape of food tell us the half story. 
There is no need for me to tell it. 
The viewer will understand what this thing is like.
The food is good.
 The restaurant is on an expensive site
 but I think it is definitely underrated.
 People need to appreciate.
Umm!!!
Nice!
Enjoyed it. 
Definitely, I think this restaurant is underrated.
And may it deserves more appreciation.
 Rest, you have understood the summary of today's video. 
 You have seen which restaurant was underrated 
and which one was right?
If we have missed any Chef's restaurant 
then please let us know in the comment section.
Thank you for watching guys.
Take care. Bye-Bye.
Bro, Chef Atul Kochhar is...
Don't talk nonsense.
How much does he talk.
 I am saying the fact.
Don't want to listen, man.
