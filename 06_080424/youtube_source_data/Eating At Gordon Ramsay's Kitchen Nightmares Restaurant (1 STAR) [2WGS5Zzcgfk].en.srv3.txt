hello before this video starts i just
want to point out that i have some brand
new merch out
this is limited edition merch so it's
only going to be out for a certain
amount of time and there's only a
certain amount
printed so if you do want one of these
awesome shirts go to brand taylor.com
pick yours up today because they won't
last all right enjoy this video okay
wait we
seen that restaurant yeah that's so
sorrows remember that's something and
chatsworth right yeah
well my question is is that fake because
how do they have all those cameras in
there how do they get someone just turn
the restaurant around how do you even do
that in 24 hours i don't know but i
haven't been there in like two years or
three years
it was like the food wasn't that great
yeah i remember it was awful last time
we went it looked
just like it did in the before so maybe
they just did a full
rebuttal of this place why don't we do
this guys why don't we figure this out
let's figure out is gordon ramsay a
complete fake because he never responded
to my dms by the way
oh yeah maybe we go try this out let's
let's go review a gordon ramsay reviewed
restaurant he turned this place around
let's see
let's see if it really happened okay
guys welcome back to a brand new episode
of
my gordon ramsay life choices i don't
really know where i'm going with this
anymore but i'm brandon taylor i'm your
host this is my mom lisa my brother jake
right behind the camera and we are gonna
go try this place out we're gonna go see
if it was turned around completely
or if this was all just for showbiz
let's go see it let's go check this out
[Applause]
[Music]
here we are captioning not
real available i think we should just
hold on filament
i like it i like it and they do like oh
wow
when we first ever started coming to
this place they literally had just an
old cinder block basically that they
would stand behind and look like crap
they didn't have anything
this is actual leather on here
which is really cool it's still like the
old character of the dad who
ran this place in 1967. they also have a
bathroom i gotta check that out later
you know
we'll be definitely checking that out we
got a little lasso man just to say so
guys
[Music]
okay so first thing that i did notice we
did a quick walk through this whole
restaurant they did not repair
anything but this room which is one a
good sign for like new people that walk
in because immediately they're gonna
think this whole restaurant is super
nice but two it's a bad thing because
they literally only focused on one room
what does that tell you that it was very
quick no they told it's
for tv yeah yeah because they didn't
even show any of the other rooms
in the video they did 24 hours repairing
this whole place and if it took 24 hours
just to repair this one room they put
some blankets up in the sky they gave it
some nice light they put these nice
little chandeliers but
they only focused on this room so if you
go through the actual restaurant you see
the old los toros from what we knew
growing up
the other rooms it's still dark and
gloomy and green walls and it's like
not inviting whatsoever this is the only
room that's bright
according to my mother it's cool though
so we almost sat back there well
because we're in 100 degrees chatsworth
weather and it's
70 in there so it is cool
[Music]
yeah i know you guys were talking about
last episode when i mentioned the guy
grabbing the cups like that
this time i caught it he grabbed the cup
just like that this is why i need a
straw unfortunately i really am against
straws because i love turtles
but in certain situations you have to
you know they should just give
paper straws to everyone although i hate
those too because they disintegrate
i'd rather a straw disintegrate than you
have to kill a turtle
fortunately these are plastic so i
thought there was a band in california
wasn't it
eco products renewable income
compost wall that's good so it means
it'll break down in natural like in the
water if it were to go into the ocean it
would just break down into nothing so
now i feel
not so bad drinking out of that to take
one of these into an experiment how long
it takes to break it down
i'd be interested because it's sitting
in water and how hasn't it not broken
down
interesting let us know 10 000 likes
we'll do it
okay so on the show they came out with
five new items and these items are used
supposedly from gordon ramsay where he
said you can charge
more for these because they're more
aesthetically pleasing so we ordered
three of those five to really try them
out and see if they taste as good
as the food did if they look as good as
they did on the episode so what they
have now is shrimp ceviche tostadas
they have roasted poblano tamale
swordfish chicken mole and garnet salad
so out of the five items we're going to
order three we're going to do the
swordfish
the shrimp and ceviche tostada and the
garnet and hopefully
they'll be exactly like gordon ramsay's
presentation was yeah because
the way that they presented each of
these looked like a high-end five-star
restaurant
let's keep in mind that i did check the
yelp reviews before we came here and
they are still at three stars so
although you know there has been a long
pass of mishaps i don't know if the show
is really helping the play-doh
or ruining it so we're going to find out
for ourselves um how are these shrimp
ceviche tostadas they're really good all
right i'm going to get that for me
can i do the carne asada let's do it
thank you
[Music]
you didn't have to ask for refills of
chips and salsa and the bean dip
usually with other restaurants you have
to be like can i get some more chips and
i get some more salsa
they literally and they brought double
instead of one they brought two of them
because they realized you liked it
so much maybe they know who you are the
other thing that i have to i just have
to play the devil's advocate is they do
see a big ass camera
they see we're filming they know they
were just on the show five months ago
they're probably trying to do anything
they can to protect their image because
in the show they did have food critics
come and like
eat the food review the food and they
were all taking pictures of their stuff
so they may be seeing us from the
backstage and are
behind the kitchen or whatever and
they're like yeah these guys you've got
to impress them get them more vegan you
know what i mean i agree i agree let's
just see how the rest let's see so the
beer is good the beans it's good chips
we all know that let's find out how this
bathroom is shall we
and this is jake's bathroom review
okay first off they did not remodel this
place at all it still has the same vibe
from when i was like 10 years old coming
in here
not the best condition like this is very
like hispanic culture like they
literally drove to rosarito and picked
all this stuff the tiles up everything
like that
window has a bunch of graffiti on it
this one
i don't even know what that is and i
don't even want to know what that is
check out the rest of the bathroom okay
got a changing room station
even the toilet seat has graffiti i
don't know how that happens
there's someone that's disrespecting
this place and that's not cool they do
have some updated urinals you know no
flush
save the water save the environment save
the turtles now let's go drink this beer
so we just overheard someone else
complain about how their food took
a long time to come it's been about 20
minutes and we still have not seen our
food he said half an hour
i think we've been at 20 minutes but
they just complained about 30 minutes
and they were here before us already
eating i don't know they're gonna come
and try to serve us some more chips
right now but i think that's literally
all the chips i can consume
they had a perfect opportunity with
gordon ramsay and boosting this place up
and trying to make it happen
and they're lacking is not going to be
good because customers aren't going to
want to return here
much longer until our food gets here
thank you
see if it's even worth eating it could
have all just been for show you know
they could have been good for a day or
two and then they slid it slack
i just it's friday and it's the
beginning of the weekend i don't want to
get sick
there was like nine people that got sick
before gordon ramsay came in here
so what we're working with here is oh a
hair
are you serious that's not my hair
that's like a
dead in the center
i mean i'm just going to pull it out and
just continue but already a hair
on my plate that's not actually looking
too good
there's literally another one on the
shrimp okay leave it alone
what do you mean you want me to eat it
no it's sitting on the shrimp right
there you just took it off
no i didn't it's right there i'm not
gonna wait another hour for them to give
it to me
so it's just like already there's like
it's open so i can't really complain but
let's just try this
there's flies everywhere i'm just gonna
give this a quick taste test
found two hairs in my food already the
actual presentation of it looks
aesthetically nice there's a lot of
colors to it and a lot of like vibrancy
so when you're looking at it you do kind
of see like a whole mesh of different
stuff you got you know a pickled onion
you got the jumbo shrimp and these are
actually jumbo pieces of shrimp
i can only imagine the size of the
actual shrimp there's radishes
cilantro there's the avocado crema on
top let me give this a taste
before gordon ramsay came into this
place the food here would just taste
like crappy mexican food this actually
tastes like something that would be like
a pop-up shop in hollywood
like very nice and very aesthetic and
like people could take pictures of these
and eat it
on a nice little summer's day right
outside of the restaurant this doesn't
taste like it comes from this place so
they did do a whole 360 with this
minus the hair minus the hair yes there
was a couple hairs in it
uh i don't know maybe on the possibility
it could have fallen out of my own head
but i didn't look like my hair
so uh yeah the food though does taste
all right the rice tastes like it was
from 11 12 o'clock lunch hour we're here
at four o'clock
so it does taste a little old
but other than that i mean the swordfish
is really good it smells very fishy
but it is fish so i remember in the
episode they did say like they were
smelling it smell rancid like a lot of
the old stuff that they did
what i've just experienced with my
family
has been shocking it was like reheated
slop
this place is known for like saving old
stuff and i mean mine didn't taste like
it was old
but that was just something that they
did talk about in the end i got a
carnosaur plate
pretty much your typical steak i asked
them how to cook whatever they recommend
so they said medium
rice beans got sour cream and avocado
and i got a chili rail on the side so
let's give it a go you know just like
look at it like
it feels very dense and dry like
like like look at it it doesn't like
have juice in it is really pink it's a
meat it's medium so it's definitely
under a little let's see how it tastes
[Music]
it's so dry if a white guy said hey i'm
barbecuing garnier salad come over
it's gonna be really good man this is
what it would taste like
they would have gone to ralph's to buy
their steak and this is
how they would have made it i think the
best part of this meal was this pickled
like
poblano chili this was the best thing i
don't think you need much to
make that you know what i mean you kind
of just throw that on the grill so yeah
this was the best part my mom tasted a
little bit of jake's and literally said
she almost choked on it because it was
that dry
one thing i have to say is that i think
if i ever return here i haven't been
here
in a while would be just for the bar i
guess have like some chips and bean dip
and margarita they're known for their
margaritas they're supposed to be really
good they have like every flavor
that's about it so the check is here
let's see how much we are helping them
get out of their 400 000
debt shall we
what the frick this is expensive yo so
what we came here for
everything we got 70 and we had hair in
our food we had cold food we had
not right meat like that's i mean i'm
we're gonna pay for it i'm gonna go
playing we ate the food but
the medela pitcher was 15 bucks shrimp
ceviche at 13. carne asada was 19.
and then the mango salsa surface was 19.
this is a business they're here to make
money
it's just i wish they would like take
more pride and serve
food that's better you have to enjoy
what you're making
i don't think this place enjoys what
they make i think even in the episode
like it didn't seem like the guy really
wanted to do that the kids that work
here they didn't want to do this either
and you can tell like when we've gone to
these little mom-and-pop shops that are
like
in the middle of nowhere or in a parking
lot and we had those burritos like you
could taste that they really care and
they want to make the best food possible
this place just doesn't follow those
standards at all so what i do want to do
though is i want to get out of here and
i want to read some of the reviews and
see like of the recent reviews and see
if people have maybe changed their mind
about the place or if they're the same
so
let's go check that out when we get back
home okay so we're back home we just ate
the place
it's been like an hour since we ate and
i feel oh i feel all right not
bad nothing bad like that we are going
to jump on their yelp their yelp does
have three stars with 1400 reviews which
is a lot of reviews to only have three
stars we're gonna look at their newest
review
since the place has been revamped and
let's see what the people are saying now
that the food has been revamped
drinks were good and reasonable price
but the food was not so great it tastes
like microwaved food
we have to agree with that but they are
trying to change because here is someone
that you know responded
from the restaurant and it looks like
it's the guy from the video it is
it's the owner it's the owner he replied
and said happy you like the drinks you
were sort of seeing the thought that the
food wasn't great is disappointing it
definitely is not microwave so i'm sorry
it didn't have that great fresh flavor
it should have i'd love to see you back
soon so we can make it up for this trip
and uh what i'm getting off of this
quick overview if you guys have seen the
gordon
ramsay episode essentially this guy
doesn't ever like to take
fault you know what i mean he's always
like no no no no and
i mean right here again it says it's
definitely not migrated like he always
has to defend himself
right and then we got two three in a row
that are now one stars so here we go
this is last month too
this was literally last month a couple
days ago 7 20 10 days ago 10 days ago
aside from the excessive amount of
overly drunk obnoxious people getting
plastered all over the place it
resembles a dark poorly lit
cave where you drink your sorrows or
pre-game a friday night don't order
drinks
off the specialist you'll be surprised
they don't know how to make mojitos
then getting ignored for 30 to 45
minutes by our waiter who was too busy
topping off the drunk slobs hackling in
the booth next to us
we eventually got our questionable food
slop just to say it's a good thing you
can't see very well in there
so it seems like they they're just like
kind of oblivious because when we went
there they took a long time to get us
our beer which we first ordered
which means the guys that were probably
serving us were in the bar room
serving all those people and not really
paying attention because the bar was
very busy so i feel like
the server it wasn't our server's fault
because he ordered it and he has to wait
till the bartender
serves it that's true so overall i
thought the service was good like
the girl brought us our chips yes we
didn't have to ask that so that's sure
you know what i think we should do i
think we should scroll back to when that
episode aired and see if there's any
like
correlation to the food being very good
in the beginning and then going downhill
again you know what i mean
oh here we go here's one about the show
okay okay here we go one star after the
show
i really wanted to give this place a
second chance after the show i went out
for dinner with my mom we ordered the
fajitas we both ended up with stomach
issues and were diagnosed with food
poisoning
i grew up coming here and will keep this
place as a childhood memory and never
return
it was not worth the next few days of
stomach cramps damn
like literally gordon ramsay gave these
people everything and they still
couldn't do it
i mean just scrolling through here i
just i see a lot of one and two stars
i don't understand how the health
department didn't like close them down
earlier though with the way the food was
on that show it showed i mean the food
was
rotten it was disgusting yeah it was
gross it was slimy
like how did the health department how
did they get through so many
years of serving stuff like that it
could have been like a non-popular
restaurant that people like
don't get checked up on because to be
honest well to be honest
i didn't see a health sign around any of
this and i walked around the building
getting shots
there was no health there was no abc
there was no health sign i looked for it
too
all i have to say if anybody wants to
try the restaurant
sit in the lit room because we found how
many we found
three hairs in two different meals and
two different meals
i dissected mine as best as i could i
didn't find anything i mean the food was
uh you know and no stomachache so that's
good but with that being said
i just don't feel personally that this
restaurant cleaned up their act i think
everything that happened in this
restaurant was for the tv show
nothing else really happened the food
like yeah it got nicer looking
yeah but it didn't get nicer tasting and
that's kind of a letdown especially with
gordon ramsay a celebrity chef coming
through and
teaching you how to run a restaurant you
still can't do it right but if you want
to see us do this more
to more gordon ramsay reviewed
restaurants and let you guys know is it
was it just for the tv show
