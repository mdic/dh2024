the average american eats over 55 pounds
of beef per year making the u.s one of
the largest consumers of steak worldwide
and today we're going to do all that in
one sitting
okay you might we're not gonna eat 55
pounds but we are gonna sample the best
steaks chain restaurants have to offer
and pick the best it's time for stick me
home tonight
i just wanna find the best one in
district mall
we're gonna taste six rounds of chain
restaurant steaks and rank them on this
bar
yes starting from the worst which is big
mistake
then filet mignon
usda okay
tenderloin care
brings the porterhouse down and rib i
love it
no maybe maybe not we'll see the steaks
we'll be tasting are outback steakhouse
applebee's sizzlers chili's texas
roadhouse and tgi fridays and we're
going to eat a sirloin from each one
because that's the only cut that they
all had yeah that was the apple store
steaks
let's do it round one
outback steakhouse no rules just fight
you ever seen a fight at an outback uh
yeah i've been in one like fist fight a
waiter just rubbed me the wrong way he
literally rubbed me and so i i
that was inappropriate
no that didn't happen uh now i'm having
my steak
medium rare because that's the correct
way to do it well mine's medium because
um
i don't care about your opinions
so i'm i'm i'm taking a bite from the
mid
full
my first real date with my wife was an
outback oh yeah
i'm a little partial
outback um
opened in 1988
after the cultural wave of crocodile
dundee
i remember that cultural wave a
crocodile dundee
um but then according to law weekly.com
as of 2014 none of the founders of uh
outback had ever been to australia
yeah you don't need to go i mean you got
encyclopedias
i like the thickness i like
i like the what they what they rub on it
yeah i like the seasoning i was going to
say the same thing it's like it's very
well seasoned pretty good this is just
ordered from the restaurant and then
brought to us so what do you want to
start at um i mean i guess we just put
it somewhere in the middle but that's
not a bad stake
by any means
that's a good start outback oh and
that's soft
round two
now i've had a lot of fun at an
applebee's
okay
this is a this is a weird looking steak
mine's weirder looking in the nearest
it's got like no but it's the wrong
color i mean i you think applebee's
thinks that beef is pork or pork is beef
no this is definitely beef but and
i mean we've got different approaches
here you've got the more picturesque
approach which is starting on the edge
i start in the middle here there doesn't
appear to be as much of a rub on this as
the outback
you know applebee's was almost called
cinnamons really yeah
cinnamons
steak tastes fine hold on are you not
struck by how different this is than the
outback steakhouse i think it's the rub
there is none it doesn't taste like
steak it tastes like
roast beef out of a package it's
disappointing if you ordered a steak
it's definitely not as good as the
outback okay i'm gonna put it below and
i can't imagine it being i'm just gonna
put it down there yeah i bet you it's
gonna stay in that zone and take this
little extra piece off you want it catch
round three the sizzler popularized the
salad bar
and uh my nanny name vicky
love the sizzler but then i realized it
wasn't the sizzler it was the western
sizzling that they left totally
different restaurant kind of the same
approach same approach sizzler started
in culver city california first of all
is this supposed to be a fish i don't
what are they
why is it so long and narrow it says
like why does it have to be so long in
there i think it's one steak
it's one steak and they're like let's
make let's make one steak two steaks no
i think they tried to turn a steak into
a chicken tender
darren mentioned it looks like the state
of california thank you yeah guy well
yeah it does i think you got it
so
that's where the call that's where it
was originated in culver city where's
that up here right there
okay
um it has the same coloring as an
applebee's steak
now josh said that there was some
confusion when he ordered this because
he said he wanted a sirloin and they
said all we have is small medium and
large
they didn't well they didn't know that
sirloin was a cut of steak
but you know what i don't think they've
ever tasted their steak i mean the the
severe charred lines are very
picturesque but
it makes it taste burnt in that zone
and that's the best part
my palate actually in the second bite
adjusted a little bit to what a sizzler
steak is
and my brain was like hold on hold on
it's not a steak it's a sizzler steak
and now almost be like i could eat a
third bite
i don't know what that says about
its ranking but
i gotta say
it is the worst yeah it's lower than the
applebee's throw it down there at the
end
and maybe we won't see it anymore yeah
sorry sizzler
round four
my first date with christy was at a
chili's
whoops
and somehow it still worked out yep um
now this is obviously they're not trying
to go for a grill mark thing this is
obviously cooked on like a griddle right
because it's all got this even
sort of sear
let me get into this whoa hold on they
put some interesting seasonings on this
i think we got our steaks mixed up man
what do you mean it's not labeled link
mine's cooked too much oh yeah try this
one i'm gonna come over here
hmm
can you taste that flavor
like a like a taco flavor almost no
like a different soup well you think
it's got southwest seasoning on it i
know i i think it's just salty i think
something got dropped on this steak i
think this steak got close to another
item because your steak tastes totally
different than my steak taste my steak i
don't want to you don't have to um
it's salty
in a good way
it i wouldn't say the seasoning goes
much beyond that i don't think it's as
good as outback but it is really good i
wouldn't say really i would say it's
pretty good
the quality of the meat
is in in this particular steak
is a little bit lower like you know how
when you got a steak that wasn't uh aged
i know this is probably not aged very
long at all but
isn't like aged properly and it kind of
has a little bit of a metallic sort of
aftertaste to it i'm tasting that in
this steak i really don't like it but
i mean it's definitely better than the
sizzler
my question is is it better than
applebee's but it's definitely not as
good as outback
i think for right now you can just put
it right here
okay
round five the tgi fridays that i
frequently was in a walmart parking lot
the view
from my booth
amazing i can see the garden center and
everything i've been to that one in cary
north carolina now the first thing i'll
note is that it's like they took a
sizzler steak and and constricted it it
got higher and it got shorter
now
it's got grill marks it's got
it's got visible seasoning and all these
things
to me
represent promise
i don't know
man the steaks are so different
this has that roast beef taste to it it
does yeah it's also a little tough
that's what happens when you start with
a sizzler steak and constrict it gets
tougher somebody tell tgi friday's that
this is not good i feel like i could see
the garden center or like like some kids
bikes through the door kind of a thing
just a greeter anything would help man
if i tasted this in front of one of
those waiters i'd just rip some of this
flare off
you don't deserve it you know i
typically don't like to blame
you know the restaurant's actions on the
server because i believe in
giving big tips to people in the service
industry but i mean come on you just
really signed up for it when you have
flare on i just don't know is this is
this
this is worse than apple this is almost
sizzler level bad
oh my god i think so
let's move it on over
okay we got a plate situation good
enough don't panic
round six
now link's mom and her husband who link
won't call his step-dad but he still
loves him love texas roadhouse
what'd y'all do today well we went to
texas roadhouse
i requested going to texas roadhouse one
time after i got back from a summer trip
but i was like what do you want i was
like texas roadhouse dad they're working
the
they're working the crisscross grill
marks okay first of all that steak cut
much more easily and that's a tender
steak that is a good piece of aged meat
right there that's somebody who cares
about a steak
okay i haven't even tasted it yet but i
can just tell by the consistency
oh man
that's a different level
it is very good
outback and texas roadhouse are the only
contenders for a steak that you should
purposely order from any of these places
oh yeah
i don't know you know what i want to do
i want to
i want to pull up my rig on the roadside
and go to the road house and get a stake
where should i go i'm in texas all right
huh i'm not ready to rank oh you're
trying to figure out which one of these
well yeah man yeah i mean are you saying
you know right i was just gonna say i
know it's somewhere in here okay
let me hack into this
okay i'm gonna go back down under we're
gonna get us some steak and we're gonna
see if it's better than uh then the
steak from the texas roadhouse oh the
road horse the roadhouse
ma'am i'd better
hold on no i'm not going to go there yet
the seasoning on the outback steakhouse
steak is
better
but i got to come back to this because
the meat is so
good you think the meat's better
yes
well my mom certainly does
i really want to be i want to get this
right i think the meter even to me it's
just a question of
do you like the seasoning which is very
strong for the outback
when you go down under and you come back
up you get yourself lots of
lots of seasoning stuck to you
like the underside of a crop you should
do the commercials because the guy does
the commercials is obviously not
australian outback steakhouse no rules
just fight
bring your
in-laws it's it's morphing man
no i think it morphed when you started
but
i don't know man
i think the meat is significantly better
at the texas roadhouse
i can always add seasoning but it's also
there's a different technique this was
done on a griddle and it's all cooked in
that's why that char is so good and this
is done on a grill with a grill marks
which actually doesn't make as good of a
steak
just ask gordon ramsay i'm voting for
outhouse
okay outhouse
you know what there's a tie
let's just go to the outhouse i'm gonna
defer to you because you like steak a
lot more than i do
here we go we're gonna throw these up
there and you're gonna make a decision
right it's on you buddy it's on you
brother all you gotta do is you gotta
figure out where it goes and then you've
gotta you
watch out for the crocs okay here's the
thing
uh just right off the bat we can't fit
all these on but sizzler doesn't even
deserve to be up here so
uh so it's off the scale
don't go to sizzler give it to the dogs
they're both good steaks again the only
steak that i can recommend to order from
any of these places but i'm gonna have
to go with
outback because where i had my first
date with jesse
look at that trying to get some brownie
points
memories baby there you go outback
steakhouse the best uh steak that you
can get from a
chain steak restaurant ain't the bloomin
onion huh anybody hey yeah thanks for
