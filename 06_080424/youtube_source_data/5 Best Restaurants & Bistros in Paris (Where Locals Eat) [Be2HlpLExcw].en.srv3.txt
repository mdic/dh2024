i never heard of cla foodie until my
mother-in-law taught me and she made it
with apples but the original cla foodie
is made with cherries this one is with a
flat currant and it is extraordinary
it's light it's fluffy and it's like oh
my god good
today we tried j german in the middle of
saint germain area and this was very
highly recommended by locals and i
understand why because you know we've
seen people who've probably been coming
to this place to eat for many many years
and it's just charming quaint small not
very many tables and the food here is
amazing like my duck fell off the bone
it was just really extraordinary and
it's the kind of place where you come
and dine for an experience because the
service isn't all that quick but you
don't mind because you're enjoying the
ambiance and the experience of it and
you're just dining but and this is the
kind of place you're just gonna have to
try
[Music]
[Music]
we are headed over to shea savvy which
is right off the champs-elysees and
right around the corner from gucci ralph
lauren chanel all of these places and
we're gonna have a great lunch so
let's go
[Music]
then we have um what's called a baby
lamb
roasted that's awesome the lamb special
of the day sounds fabulous to me another
pork chop it has a sweet potato on the
bottom ah perfect really good
i thought it was butter but this is
riaz
that right there is pear this restaurant
goes back to 1920
and you can feel the age of it a little
bit even though it's been modernized
some but they kept the old feeling and
the menu
has very typical things you know we
haven't done in a video before the bone
marrow which is a very parisian very
french thing to do so i'm going to try
that today
and by the way our waiter's name is
sebastian and he was born here
grew up in the u.s perfect english so
this cute little spoon is for me to dig
the marrow out of the bone and if it's
not salty enough i've got this cute
little pot of salt that i can add salt
and put it on little points of this
bread so let's check it out
[Music]
again is a staple of uh a french food
and they had a world championship
contest for your mayonnaise they didn't
win but they were selected as the
finalists for abdominis this is amazing
and the presentation is really really
cool so
i'm gonna give it a shot
[Music]
merci
and what i got is a pork chop
served with a glaze sauce uh served on a
bed of mashed sweet potatoes that sounds
like heaven so
bon appetit so what i got is roasted
lamb and i'm ready to try that it comes
with roasted peppers and eggplants and
celery and different vegetables and it
smells incredible
[Music]
today we're gonna go have lunch at the
bistro de paris and again it's another
gem where the locals eat and i can't
wait to try it let's go
[Music]
today we're having lunch at the bistro
de paris and i'm starving i can't wait
and this place looks charming i bet the
food's just as good what they gave us
here is radishes with a little butter
and some bread and that's a really
typical parisian touch so that's that
already is setting the mood we're in
paris here
so when you're in a restaurant and they
ask you what you want to have to drink
the aperitif is usually something a
little more special so
champagne it's a wine glass for most
americans but champagne is a perfectly
good pair of teeth we don't save it for
special occasions in france we drink it
all the time with pizza with whatever
you want and certainly before lunch it's
a good option
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
[Music]
yes i'm a happy camper
[Music]
the seasoning in here there's capers
that wakes up the flavor of the meat
it's just so good it may sound crazy to
eat ravi
but oh my god it's good it's it's
classic french
and i know why it's just good
[Music]
[Music]
how are you
[Music]
there was a time
when i thought profiterole is just a
cream puff with ice cream and chocolate
sauce
but there's so much more than that it's
just it's hard to explain how good this
really is
i know that and when you go to paris you
gotta go to versailles you gotta lose
you gotta see the eiffel tower
you have
the ad
eating coffee to all chocolate
while you stay here this is one of the
most magnificent dessert a cream puff
vanilla ice cream hot chocolate sauce
sometimes they put a little bit of
almonds
but it's just like
trust me make room for dessert and try
it before you go back home
[Music]
[Music]
and today we're going to go and try a
quintessential french bistro called le
petit random right there they have
amazing french food and also one of the
best jumbo beer you can have in paris so
let's go
[Music]
it is lunchtime in paris at a parisian
spot and it is hopping
he stole my wine but i don't drink beer
so
people
[Music]
they don't eat french fries with ketchup
they eat them with mayonnaise
[Music]
i never in my life imagine pistachio
flavored creme brulee that's good stuff
[Music]
[Music]
