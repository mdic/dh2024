We are back in Copenhagen for the restaurant 
that turned Denmark into a gastro-nation.
It’s name is Noma.
Arguably the best restaurant in the world 
will close for good at the end of 2024.
Opened in 2003, it got a lot 
of attention in a weird way.
From a document.
I know, weird.
Right?
It was called the Manifesto 
of the New Nordic Kitchen.
Written by food activist 
and entrepreneur Claus Mayer
with a handful of Scandavian chefs, it 
redefined the rules for Nordic cooking.
Basically it says…
New Nordic cuisine must keep traditional 
methods and use ingredients that are in season.
On the other hand, it needs 
to innovate, be passionate
and create new ways to use 
traditional Nordic foods.
After it was presented at the Nordic 
Kitchen Symposium, people freaked out,
and the concept caught on like wild fire.
It would change not only 
Denmark, but the whole region,
inspiring dozens of chefs and pushing 
Scandavia into the world’s culinary spotlight.
And standing center stage was Rene Redzepi.
Head chef of Noma.
When he was 15, Rene dropped out of high school
and signed up for cooking school.
After, he trained as an apprentice at a local 
Michelin-starred restaurant called Pierre Andre.
From there, he spent time cooking in France
and then in Spain where he worked at El Bulli.
He returned to Copenhagen and 
took a position at Kong Hans
but took a break to spend a season at The French
Laundry alongside Thomas 
Keller in the Napa Valley.
In 2002, the 24 year old chef was approached
by Claus Meyer who offered him 
the opportunity of a lifetime.
Head chef of the brand new Noma.
The name Noma comes from 
a mix of two Danish words.
Nordisk, which means Nordic,
and mad which means food.
They opened in 2003.
In fact, the first few 
years were an uphill battle.
Turns out, Danish people were not 
so adventurous with their food.
They were used to traditional 
dishes like roast pork and potatoes.
And left the local food landscape unexplored.
For example, out of 55 
edible berries in the region,
people ate only 7.
Redzepi knew that changing what 
people eat would not happen overnight.
But many wondered if it was possible at all.
After simmering for a few years, 
things finally started to heat up.
By 2006, it reached a rolling boil.
Sustainability, simplicity and 
freshness became the order of the day.
Three years in a row, from 2010 to 2012,
Noma was named best restaurant in the world.
They would go on to claim the 
number one spot a total of 5 times.
Something that’s been done only 
once before - by El Bulli in Spain.
Despite all their success, the Michelin guide 
held Noma to 2 stars for more than a decade.
Finally in 2021, they gave Noma the third.
So now that you know how special this place is,
I have some bad news.
This year is your last chance to try Noma.
At the end of 2024, Noma will 
close it’s doors for good.
It’s not the first time Chef 
Redzepi has made such a bold move.
In 2012, Noma closed to open a pop-up in London.
In 2015, they did the same, this time in Japan.
In 2016, it was Australia.
In 2017, Mexico.
In 2016, they took a year off.
and in 2018, reopened in the 
current building as Noma 2.0.
Then during Covid, they closed 
completely and became a burger bar.
So no doubt, Chef Redzepi has 
something else up his sleeve.
What could it be?
We arrive at Noma’s garden village.
We didn’t see any signs, just a collection of 
small buildings, greenhouses and raised beds.
We arrive at the main building 
covered in deer antlers -
a sign of what’s to come.
Stepping in, we are met with this.
Hello from everybody.
What a reception!
Heartwarming from the start.
Love it.
The staff are energetic and excited to talk.
That’s when I learn we are in 
for something really special.
It’s something I rarely get to 
experience when dining abroad.
A server that can speak my mother tongue!
This is Szabolcs, and he speaks Hungarian.
and because of him, I know this 
is going to be a special night.
Welcoming us to the table is this 
guinea fowl in a thick salt crust.
We are also presented with an 
outrageous amount of mushrooms
that are going to make their 
way back to the table later.
As you can see, everything is out in the open,
almost begging you to ask about it.
Gone are the traditional white tablecloths.
In it’s place is warm Scandanavian design 
using all natural materials, mostly wood.
The staff uniforms are more function 
than fashion, but by no means sloppy.
It helps to set the atmosphere 
to informal and relaxed.
Noma is open just 4 days a week from Tuesday 
to Friday, and is open for lunch and dinner.
There are 40 seats, but four of 
them are reserved for students
to try the gourmet experience at a lower cost.
If you are by yourself, you are still welcome.
You can reserve a seat at the shared table
and make new friends while you 
experience a food paradise.
The menu is divided into three themes, 
showcasing food seasons and its best ingredients.
From January to June, it’s Ocean season.
July to September is Vegetable season.
October to December is Game and Forest season.
That’s what we are trying today.
The menu will set you back 535 euros,
but you are also expected 
to choose a drink pairing.
The wine package goes for 280 euros
while the juice pairing is 215.
For me the choice is easy.
First to hit the palette is a 
sparkling wine from Triple A.
Suddenly, the menu begins.
Here, they have done away with the little 
bites and amuse bouches, and dive straight in.
First is guineafowl - juicy and tender breast with
a dipping sauce of hazelnut 
milk, rendered fat and koji.
On the side is caramelized 
skin roasted over charcoal,
and guineafowl egg with nettles.
It looks and smells good,
but for taste and texture I was 
hoping for some acid and some crunch.
Next at the table, one large pear.
It’s straight off the tree.
Just how I like it.
Almost.
Watch this.
This is pear salad with sea buckthorn.
It was really good, and really fresh.
and I also really love the presentation.
Up next, it’s something totally unique.
What do you think it is?
In a million years, you would never guess.
You’ve heard of the probiotic 
drink called kombucha.
This is what they use for fermentation.
It’s called scoby, and it stands for 
Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.
I know how it sounds, but it was brilliant.
It’s cultivated with crowberry tea, brushed 
with larch oil and drizzled with bergamot.
It’s presented beautifully 
on a solid chunk of clear ice
and it's juicy and chewy, in a good way.
On the side is a fabulous stuffed hip berry.
With this dish, the kitchen is 
really flexing their science muscles.
Proving that Noma is as much research 
institute as it is restaurant.
Partnered with this dish is 
also something unconventional.
A 2019 Cotillon des Dames from Jean Yves Peron.
This one is a real sniffer.
It smells amazing.
This is a skin-contact wine, 
also called orange wine.
To make it they use the skins, the 
seeds and sometimes even the stems.
What comes out is a complex, deep and mineral 
wine lower in alcohol but higher in antioxidants.
So it’s even healthier than regular wine.
Next, pumpkin pie.
It’s interesting how they follow up an 
adventurous dish with something common.
It’s good, and the presentation is great.
but in terms of creativity and taste,
it’s a little step back, 
compare to the previous dish.
Next, a bowl of walnuts.
Sounds pretty basic, and it is.
But it’s also amazing.
Each fall, Noma’s beekeeper brings 
fresh walnuts from his tree,
and each year they find a way to 
incorporate them into the menu.
Part of the daily prep work at 
Noma includes cracking the shells
and carefully peeling the skin away to 
reveal the tender meat of the walnut.
It’s paired with a balanced and 
full-bodied Japanese sake served warm.
Up next, this.
Cherry leaf sandwich.
But it’s more like an ice cream sandwich.
It’s crisp cherry leaves with 
foamy goat cheese ice cream.
They make things really interesting by 
adding white truffle from Piedmonte.
Hey that’s not Danish!
That’s cheating!
Technically, yes, but I was happy they did.
It set up a wonderful balance 
of flavor and texture.
Umami, salty, sweet, creamy, light, and crunchy.
One of the best of the meal so far.
Speaking of things I like, the 
interior here is super inviting.
And the atmosphere created by 
the staff is something special.
And it’s clear they are not trying to 
impress, they are just doing their thing.
Nothing fancy or high-end.
That said, I love a nice glass and wish I had one.
The rest, is brilliant.
Our next wine is from French producer
who is a former musician turned 
winemaker producing unfiltered wine.
This one is an acidic Chenin 
that is absolutely vibrant.
It’s paired with wild boar 
belly, apple, and lingonberry.
Just look at that fat.
You know what that means.
Fat means flavor!
And this dish has lots of it.
Nice classic combo with pork and apple.
This is an outstanding one.
Chef Rene Redzepi drops by.
He has come to show us something.
At first, I think it’s pork belly.
But turns out, it’s scoby.
Remember that dish we had earlier?
This is where it started from.
I’m not sure I needed to see or smell that,
but when a superchef casually drops by your table
just to show you something in 
a huge jar, it’s pretty cool.
Next, we have gelatin made with mushroom.
On top is a ring of fresh sunflower 
seeds and in the middle, whipped cream.
Interesting and pleasant texture 
with a heavy umami flavor.
Coming up, we have a clever dish that will 
make you curious or turn your stomach.
It’s an omelette, made with reindeer brains.
It starts with a thin egg pancake 
and pheasant garum with kelp salt,
then folded around a filling.
That filling has a healthy 
amount of reindeer brains.
Sounds weird, but actually it has a 
soft, creamy texture like custard,
it’s delightfully acidic with exciting flavors.
It’s served in a foamy, 
buttery pheasant garum sauce.
Genius! I loved every bite.
Our next wine is a 2017 pinot noir.
It’s the top rated year for this wine and 
features dark fruit and light tannins.
To go with it is a wild mushroom ragou.
It’s sauteed mushrooms and herb salad
with crispy pieces of chestnut 
served in a beeswax bowl.
Very nice.
Our next course is another one gets 
people talking or leaves them speechless.
Reindeer tongue.
It’s pan-fried in butter 
and thyme until medium rare
and served on a sharpend reindeer antler.
It’s served with a special herbed 
butter sauce made with oxidized wine,
a Noma Projects vinegar and pine salt.
The tongue was chewy but tender 
and full of meaty flavor.
Exceptional.
Our next wine is something really different.
It’s called Gabriel’s wine and it’s 
made in the country of Georgia.
It’s made from saperavi grape.
And this wine is completely handmade,
using a centuries old method of 
aging in clay pots under the ground.
Out next is our main course.
Grilled fallow deer and autumn 
pickles in a horseradish sauce.
With it is city loaf sourdough 
bread from the Hart Bageri,
one of Chef Redzepi’s side projects.
The deer was spot on and 
this bread is something else!
Next is dessert.
Starting with pine resin jelly.
This is one of the creations 
from the test kitchen.
Starting with pine resin, first they soak it 
and then cook it for hours with wine and sugar,
and then form it into little lumps.
After they soak it again, it balloons to 
ten times the size and becomes this jelly.
It has a unique texture, and 
a slightly pine cone flavor.
Our next dessert is an ice cream spaghetti
made from fresh hazelnuts and hazelnut 
oil, candied chanterelles and berries.
This was really good.
Finally we have three final sweets.
Woodruff and pine caramel
Candied pinecone (cooked in sugar)
and finally a chocolate sauce with a sumac flower.
The flower is used as a 
sponge to eat the chocolate
and gives it an acidic kick. 
 
This was my favorite.
After our meal, our generous waiter 
Szabolcs gives us the grand tour.
We see everything, no door goes unopened.
When all is said and done, 
we make our way to the door.
They say goodbye like they said hello,
with all hands on deck.
And present us a parting gift 
from Noma Project on the way out.
Our total for today is just 
under 2000 for two people.
What a great experience.
Sadly, it cannot be had for much longer.
The clock is ticking.
Next year, Noma will be ‘nomo.’
We found out its fate in January 2024.
From 2025, Noma will no 
longer serve as a restaurant.
It will be used as a test kitchen and 
they will sell the products online.
Although Chef Redzepi didn’t spill the beans,
I have no doubt that he will surprise us somehow,
and Noma will continue in some shape or form.
What can I say about this experience?
I’ve been here before, but 
this time was a game changer.
To be served in Hungarian, 
this was a first for me.
I actually got to experience a 
3-michelin star in my mother tongue.
It was kinda magical.
The only thing I wasn’t crazy about 
was the all-natural wine pairing.
It was a really good selection 
made by the sommelier,
but natural wines just aren’t my thing.
When I look at Noma as a restaurant, 
I wouldn’t say it’s my favorite.
When I see it as a movement that made 
a lasting impact on a lot of people,
it has no equal.
And not just in Denmark, but on 
the world of gastronomy and beyond.
It inspires and shows the way 
and this will continue on.
Although the restaurant as 
we know it will say goodbye,
their way of thinking is not going anywhere.
and that does it for this episode.
Thank you for joining me!
