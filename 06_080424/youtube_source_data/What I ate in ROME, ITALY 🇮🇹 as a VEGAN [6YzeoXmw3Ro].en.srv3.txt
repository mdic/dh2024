hello beautiful people if you guys
haven't heard yet I am doing a vegan
trip to Costa Rica in January and you
are invited this is basically a group
holiday where we're going to be eating
tons of delicious vegan food going on
lots of Adventures and learning all
about Costa Rica from a local guide so
if you want to come on a trip with me
and my best friend slash podcast co-host
Daniel definitely check out the link
below to get all of the details and the
full itinerary there are limited spots
available so make sure you book now see
you there ciao
[Music]
we are in Rome oh my gosh we got here
yesterday and oh look at that sun and
what did we do yesterday we walked
around drink wine
and we had a lovely dinner and then we
came home because we're grannies
the plan was to go out but we were very
tired and also I'm very jet-lagged so
we'll do that tonight we'll do that
tonight we're gonna go out tonight
that's the plan so the first day in Rome
my friend and I walked around and we
drank espresso and Vino all day this was
my first time back in Rome in about 10
years or so and I forgot how beautiful
Rome is I will say though that we went
in June and it was already really really
hot so definitely don't recommend going
in like July or August because you may
die of heat anyway Rome is awesome
because it's basically literally an
outdoor Museum so everywhere you go
there's always something beautiful to
look at there's so much history so much
culture it is so beautiful and when we
got to the Spanish Steps which is one of
the tourist destinations we realized
that they were having some sort of red
carpet event for the new Mission
Impossible movie and can you guys let me
know if you can spot Tom Cruise on the
red carpet there okay okay let me know
if you see him because he is there okay
for dinner we went to this vegan
restaurant called mava and we sat
Outside The Vibes were immaculate we got
a few appetizers I really liked this
soup I forgot what the soup was but it
was really good okay and we got like a
bunch of little dishes to share and the
star of the show guys was this spaghetti
with pistachio cream
I mean come on okay
spaghetti with pistachio Creek it was so
good
that's how you start this morning this
is our first full day
in Rome both of us have been here before
but quite a few years ago
for me it's been like 10 years for you
it's been what seven yeah we woke up
somewhat early
it's pretty early yeah it's like seven
No 7 20 okay really okay so we woke up
pretty early because we want to get to
the Trevi Fountain
um early
so that it's not so crowded so we can
get some nice uh insta shots
and we are now approaching
the traffic fountain
and I think we did a good job waking up
early to come here because
it's definitely gonna get super crowded
later and uh
look how crowded it is it's so crowded I
think you could have come here at like
six I think that's the only time but
then it would be dark
horrible let's move out of the way okay
we got our photos
well I think we should admire the view a
little bit
[Music]
we're in
Russia
I don't know Cafe
um
nothing like fresh is these orange juice
everything I've ever wanted and more
so we got espresso or a cafe tofio which
is Double Espresso because the small
ones are too small oh we got
a piece of toast
for 16 euros 16 years so expensive we
are in the pantheon
pops let's jump off so thoughts on the
pantheon beautiful just like most of
most of yes
Roman architecture
[Music]

actually open this is the third one
we're trying okay where's the vegan
stuff

here we are there's the calls we're not
going in this time I've been inside
twice so no need to go in and plus you
have to get tickets in advance and we
definitely do not get tickets so we will
not go in but we will enjoy The View
from outside
[Music]
oh wow so we got cacio Pepe vegan Pepe
um spaghetti with truffles
and then what was this one
vegan taco
oh mine looks so good
salty
but with the arugula it kind of balances
it out and it taste of truffle is so
good okay
[Music]
I'm probably gonna eat most of it
because Chrissy is full

long Siesta three hours I think that was
