types of Cuisines so I'm excited to
taste it all and to show you what we eat

before heading to our first official
meal of Vienna my mom got a hot
chocolate and a croissant at our hotel
not much to add because I didn't have
any so let's move on to the next place
first destination was a restaurant
called Flora

noibel this place was excellent I got
the eggs benedict and a chai latte as
well as some kind of lemonade

so shared the corn ribs my mom also
enjoyed them she got an egg sandwich my
dad also got the eggs benedict Jacob as
well but he met us later because he had
a work meeting and here's my mom
just being herself and just some
mid-meal cuddles you'll see that's a
theme here because like why not

on our way to the schmetalink house I
don't think we're gonna have lunch today
because we had a pretty big brunch
everyone just have dinner and yeah I'll
see you when we have dinner
[Music]
I see a standing culture here that's
survived as the Empire that it was and
now fast forward to today where Austria
is Austria it provides optimism so in
the midst of a loss
how to survive and survive Prosper so
it's okay to lose power but still
maintain a new way people
America does not have to be great again
America has to be America who move
forward amen
