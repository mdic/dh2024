one of the worst pizzas of my
life this is a [ __ ]
scam we are in Venice the gem of Italy a
symphony of art culture and nature where
the enchantment never Fades away such a
poetic beginning for an episode that
might be filled with unpleasant stomach
problems and terrible food buckle up
we're visiting the worv restaurant in
[Music]
Italy you're all familiar with the
routine let's open Trip Advisor and
browse through the restaurants of 10 of
the biggest Italian cities including the
entire regions of Sicily and Sardinia
this way we're basically covering most
of Italy take all the boxes here
navigate to the very last page of each
City and find the app absolutely worst
restaurants of a country with arguably
the best food in the world I'm very
curious give me a
[Music]
minute ladies and gentlemen we're going
back to Milan the worst rude restaurant
in Italy is named minor resturante
pizeria bar and check this out one star
on trip advisor with over 1,500 reviews
and get ready for more shocks 95% of the
reviews are one star ones 1.1 on Google
reviews I've never seen something like
that almost every guest must have left
disgusted and
appalled what the hell have we just
found this looks like a standard
restaurant look look happy employees
happy guests all right the food looks
average but nothing suggests this could
be the absolutely worst restaurant of an
entire 60 million
country something doesn't add up here
looking at the words most often
mentioned in the reviews I think I'm on
to something scam tourist trap Thief
ripoff Scandal let's read some of the
reviews and find out why minera Doro
which translates to gold mine is such a
horrible establishment the owner and the
bouncer beats customers in front of the
place after I called for the police he
said there is no police in Italia we
paid €42 for pizza and coffee I told the
server that I was going to put in a
negative review and he literally pushed
me out of the door shocking for be you
pay €20 they got mad and treated us
badly they even threw in our faces the
change from the bill we paid the beers
with absolute ripoff €35 for a plate of
Letts and a few pieces of of CH they
will charge you to charge your phone and
for the smallest things you can imagine
we asked for ketchup and he asked us how
many we had four sachets little did we
know until the pill came that each small
CET cost €2 a fraud they don't offer you
a menu then they try to convince you to
order what they want the most expensive
the waiter quite rud and to top it off
you can't pay by car due to an alleged
recli failure we didn't go the police
because we were with a little kid I mean
we've been to some overpriced tourist
trp restaurants on our show but this is
some Next Level overpriced tourist trap
gold mine is apparently really living up
to its name I really want to find out
how the hell can this restaurant get so
many customers and what's the secret of
their long-term existence asking for
money for charging your phone that's
unheard of anyway I'm really glad we
robbed the bank because we'll need a lot
of money and nerves of Steel let's get
ourselves scammed

European travel essential I'm glad my
internet is settled because according to
the reviews the Wi-Fi in Min adoro is
not free welcome to Milan once again
we were here just recently checking out
the worst reviewed Hotel of Italy and
now it's time for the overpriced tourist
trap possibly the biggest tourist trap
of Our Lives we're going to play the
role of typical lost tourists trying to
get ourselves lured in and pushed to
order food and drinks the servers
recommend will the food be edible or
will we leave not only broke but also
hungry let's find
out
if there's one thing we learned after
visiting many worst reviewed restaurants
all around Europe it's that they all
rely on luring you in from the
street
beer yes why not yeah we're actually
looking for
something do you want to have one
beer
beer yeah two
beer they wasted no time the beers
arrived in under a minute to an ordinary
guest this would seem like exemplary
Swift service but to us it felt like
rushing why such
urgency well my wallet is already
crying too money
Che extremely
expensive what about some antipasti
first let let's splash the cash let's
let's have some starter as well now you
may have noticed the poor audio quality
of this part of the video we were forced
to use the sound from vlat spy glasses
and a GoPro hidden in my back next to a
small fan to prevent overheating
normally we'd used our regular camera
but as you'll soon discover the
suspicious staff around us made that imp
possible so hi so uh we would like to
try at anti pasty what kind of antipasti
CPR you want
toed
BR okay okay
okay yes the
camera no
camera it's my my glass no this no
there's no camera no it's just just I
think the camera
because I think it was a camera it's
just the style of my glass style of his
glasses okay thank you very much yeah oh
sorry we almost got exposed but we
played it pretty well I think we should
uh hide the the Panasonic G7 right now
so they are not more suspicious hide the
G7 we're we're just going to use the
gold from
okay the drinks are not listed on the
menu there are no
drinks
thank thank you thank you to be
completely honest the food looked
phenomenal and tasted that's it yeah
it's really good
about 10 out of 10 both of
topping is so well seasoned very fluffy
but crunchy at the same time always
keeping the Tre on this show I think
what we should do is finishing the beers
as fast as possible so we'll see if
they're going to be pushing for one more
round of beer I finished my beer and
wondered how long will it take for the
servers to
[Music]
notice
yes yeah of
course thank you that's absolutely unbel
the moment I finished it was here you
were still
finishing I finished my sentence exactly
35 seconds after we ordered the second
round of
[Music]
beers indeed a very Swift service
let's be really slow with this beer cuz
I don't have 500 in my
wallet surprised by the quality of
starters we checked the overpriced on
trace and got ready for the main course
what we we want like pizza and
pastaa
salad
salad for
the back page of the menu listed all the
hidden costs €2 per person for table
service 15 minutes of Wi-Fi usage a
small saet of ketchup or mayonnaise
calling a taxi and charging your phone I
have a socket here can you give me the
charger it's charging let's see what
this will lead to thank you wow thank
you very much good thank you so
much pizza was very
underwhelming
right this is overcooked this is not
alent it's definitely a downgrade from
the starter how much did it cost is it
€30 for
this that
hurts
this is the kind of pizza I would expect
in like in a fast food counter average
and bl one of the worst pizzas of my
life my glass is empty and the vultures
are still not here I'm going to ask if
they can bring me tap water I'm pretty
sure they're going to bring me water
that will cost like €
10 thank
you we're not smiling that much so let's
uh do you know any joke
without racist content

you it's dirty dirty in Milan it's dirty
here well then uh uh

dirty Temple such a coincidence probably
some old tubes here some SE problem pool
guys it's the first time in my life I'm
not going to finish a pizza are you

improved a lot so please go there and
make a comprehensive review of the
toilet please don't don't show your car
