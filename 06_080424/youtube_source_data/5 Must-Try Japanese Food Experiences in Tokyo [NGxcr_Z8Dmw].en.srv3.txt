as you're probably already aware japan
is famous for its food and tokyo is the
epicenter of all of those different
options and sometimes it can be a little
overwhelming
just how many food options there are so
i'm going to take you around and show
you five great japanese food experiences
for you to try next time you're in japan
i'm out of breath because i'm already
late for dinner let's start out at a
traditional japanese grill here we go
[Music]
let's kick things off for the
traditional japanese grill or robota
[Applause]
where barbecue bastards cook all the
cars in the center of the room and use
long wooden spatulas to deliver
everything
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
start out with a few appetizers whole
prawns and these delicious crunchy
little crabs
[Music]
then move on to veggies sweet potatoes
grilled peppers special soup and chicken
with leeks
for the main course start with a flaky
somewhat ugly fish and a massive king
crap
[Music]
and one interesting item that you should
try is the roasted and salted ginkgo
bulova
it said that if you have too many of
these they're poisonous but only a few
is supposed to be great for your health
weird nutty bean
with a
very strong aftertaste
it tastes a little bit i taste a little
bit like um
poison at the end of it
good with the salt on them but i don't
know
it tastes a little bit a little bit like
poison very good a little bit more
[Music]
now we are in ramen street in the
basement of the tokyo station a whole
mess of restaurants down here shops
delicious looking food everywhere
some dumplings there sushi back there
beer lineup over here
but we're gonna get some ramen that this
street is named after let's go
this place number two on the list is the
world famous japanese ramen and the most
important aspect of this culinary
experience is deciding on just what type
of ramen you like
my personal favorite is the pork bone
broth or tonkatsu ramen
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
ramen
and ramen street
[Music]
a little brother
oh baby
that's good
favorite street in town
[Music]
so
next up we visit the tiny little tokyo
restaurants who serve up meat on a stick
or yakitori many places will focus on
one particular animal chicken beef or
pork and some only offer one specific
item like beef tongue with all these
choices i usually opt for the chicken
option
skin heart
sugar
chicken balls
and when you're having yakitori always
meet new friends that's just the way
yakitori is coming to a little place
like this
jersey guy in georgia
just meet new people when you're here
[Music]
number four on our list we go to where
the sumos eat
[Music]
[Music]
all right for tonight's meal we are in
the neighborhood of rio goku and we're
having a dish called chanko nabe this
masterful little piece right here
and with me on this adventure is miles
michaelis you might know him as the star
pitcher of your tokyo giants
insert applause right now
[Music]
so this is the neighborhood famous for
its sumo wrestlers this is where they
live eat and dine and this is the dish
that they all eat so we just actually
went over and saw some of the sumos and
where they
trained it's the training facility
where all the boys get after it
you know that whole crew
come on
nice guys
and now we're going to dig in to the
feast
are you ready
ready
first we're giving an interesting
porridge like appetizer some chicken
wings and then we just wait for the
chanko nabe to cook
tofu shrimp mushrooms
meatballs
surprise leeks
[Music]
shallots
maybe onions little bok choy
that looks like ground up octopus
to put things into perspective this is
two servings that miles and i share and
one of the sumo guys just told us that
he goes through two or three servings
himself when he's trying to gain weight
i don't know if you've read any of the
stories
what's your favorite part
the broth is the best part
we went with the misu style broth
and it does look there it is
[Music]
yeah this the broth is really good udon
noodles are perfect great soundtrack
tofu is always sketchy in my book the
chicken balls are top-notch we're about
to try these
sardine balls well we as in me
might as well touch this sauce
let's try to start eating more
that was a
[Music]
okay i like fish ball that's a
completely different texture than the
chicken ball really you're gonna hate
that it's much softer than the chicken
ball your face didn't
[Music]
starting ball
if you go on knowing that it's sardine
or fish it's really really tasty
[Music]
yeah you got any bacon yet no slice me a
piece of that
[Music]
nobody
[Music]
that is the damage done
chicken wings
all right my porridge
this is the sauce how do you feel
sumo wrestler
tired feeling like a sumo wrestler we
did good right
that's it chunko nabe check
that was a lot of food but it was really
delicious
we ate pretty much everything except the
tofu i am stuck now that i think about
it pretty stuffed it's a delicious meal
got to see whether sumo is hanging out
say i'm full i don't have anything else
to say
on to the next one
and the fifth japanese food experience
that you have to try when you're in
tokyo especially
is the world famous sushi as you saw
from the fish market video there are a
million different ways that it's
prepared but one of the most fun way is
with one of these conveyor belt style
restaurants where the food just zooms in
right to you let's go check it out
okay conveyor bao sushi you get a number
connected with a specific seat and
computer screen and from there you do
all your ordering be careful though the
efficiency and discretion of
self-service can get out of bounds real
quick just select the items you want
press order and within minutes the sushi
will come flying in from heaven on a
tray take your plates off send the
transporter back enjoy
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and then when you had enough just close
out your tab on your monitor and go pay
at the counter it is the most
streamlined sushi experience you'll ever
have
all right so those are the five
japanese food experiences that you have
to try
there's one more that i want to show you
i think this is pretty important let's
go that way
in japan the convenience store is a big
aspect of local life and there are three
major players family mart lawsons and
7-eleven and the treats inside are as
interesting as they are tasty
you got all your sake selection
tons of green teas
squid jerky this is my personal favorite
like gatorade
aloe vera
this is really good these are delicious
these are all vitamin packs
pasta sandwich
corn
now you got all these prepared dishes
looks
[Music]
pasta delicious
marinara sauce
these little rice guys
individually wrapped chicken that's
cheeseburgers hot dogs
but the best of all
these guys
you got strawberry and whipped cream
we got tuna and egg salad
ham and cheese

my personal favorite
is the egg salad with the pork it's like
a bacon and egg sandwich in the morning
