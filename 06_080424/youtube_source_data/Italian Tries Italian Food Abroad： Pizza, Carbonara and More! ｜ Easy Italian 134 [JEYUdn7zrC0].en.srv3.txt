matteo everything is fine
I know I miss Italy the food a bit
but Italian food can also be found here
tonight Italian dinner we'll take care of
the good hands let's see
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
sad place on toasted toast
spaghetti alphabet spaghetti
Bolognese and ravioli all in
sweet tomato sauce
[Music]
ok
basically we eat as children
or at least when I was little I
ate a lot of this stuff but
this
tomato sauce sweet tomato sauce
[Music]
[Applause]
sweet and alphabetical  spaghetti
[Music]
very good mine spaghetti on toast
are good
and
[Music]
they seem to have consistency but they don't
have it therefore and it
's not the
Bolognese thing on toast
but Bolognese exists in Italy no that is yes
hand
the flavor is
strange  the consistency
[Music]
but it's spaghetti
but there's a lot of it but how do you eat it like this
guys but it's the pasta that has to
be substantial no the bread penne with
chicken and mushrooms in cream and
parsley sauce
that is to say I'll pass them to the check in motion rim
then let's get started  to the fact that pasta
with chicken doesn't exist in Italy because I don't
know but it doesn't exist there isn't chicken and
pasta no no
so it's not Italian then cream
isn't put much in dishes anymore,
very bad that is  overcooked pasta and
we have a problem with pasta but
we now know that pasta is difficult to
make outside of Italy
but as you know
it's a bit of rubbish
but therefore it's good, acceptable but it
has nothing to do with Italy, maybe they
come  after alphabets spaghetti f
but it's not bad
wine for you sir yes thank you
fantastic prosecco rosé
controlled designations of origin
i cali minute would you like to taste
yes of course I
remind you a little about Italy yes of course you don't
know that I myself ate Italian things
in England in Italian restaurants  and
not but it was Italian and good in
England why are you making me
eat all these things spaghetti
carbonara with cream and bacon
but the panda a woman not at all
but the cream but sorry the man
[Music]
maybe he's not there but he's not there  'It's a place
and the Carbonarese
is well known but what is it but with cream but
then I'm afraid to eat it
no
this carbonara this and
overcooked pasta with cream
and bacon instead of bacon but
no but not ham either  it's bacon
I feel much more at home
well because now the lasagna is coming the
lasagna
during my what
goes well it
can be this
trust I have faith in the lasagna
okay the commitment is there there should be
more than full between the sheets of pasta
there should  to be something
here there is little and nothing
and then it should should always be a bit
simple because here you don't
understand anything that is like it seems to me and
cellars or in the tomato
the béchamel I don't know if béchamel
maybe the cheese and that's it and the pasta and
how to  It's usually
overcooked but it's similar to a lasagna that you
might find in a supermarket and I'm
starting to feel more like I'm in Italy, actually
I don't need a break I'll go for a
moment you don't want to I'll go I'll
go I'll go
I'm very tired and we're only at
the beginning
I hope that  are you having fun also
because for me it's a bit of a pain
but oh well speaking of fun
at the moment registrations are
open to our online school in
our online school obviously we focus
everything on fun and therefore all the
elections are very personal and
fun based on our  life or the
life of the professors and then the grammar
which I like so much but you have to
learn it and therefore there are
very simple and clear explanations and we will
never leave you alone both in the chat room
where you can practice leaving
your messages and receiving feedback from the
professors and  spin clubs
live conversation lessons where you can get
to know the professors and us and your classmates more
to find out more
the link and description I have to
go now because they cooked a lot
and so let's say wait respect me
doctor's pizza optician with chicken
tasty spinach corn mozzarella is the
cheese and [ __ ] accompanied by an
allowance blended with garlic and parsley
oh my goodness
ok check in for that goal but how much stuff
5 st chicken the pizzas like pasta and chicken
so no and then there's a lot  of stuff I'm
poor eating
it is similar to a small one and it could be
found many years ago in supermarkets
now even that in supermarkets and
better
but the fundamental thing is that it's
usually there
we don't put a lot of stuff in the pizza or
in the dishes or in the preparations of
usually there are few ingredients
and we tend to enhance them with small things
like
herbs or
other elements
spinach chicken corn and
what is this garlic cream no
no galic plaid doesn't exist in Italy but I
have to confess that it's one of the things
that I like  I like it better, it does
n't take me to Italy much, but I
really like mozzarella to eat,
I understand that Charles Schumer and it's
not made,
that is, at least you,
the mozzarella isn't from Lombardy
12
I'm afraid to taste this,
this piece of cheese
isn't that different from that  that
we find in supermarkets
but they continue to make me strange the fact
that it says it comes from Lombardy
as if to say you know that
Lombardy is not famous for its
mozzarella let's put it this way if you like it
yes
as fresh cheese and yes but
mozzarella you can't call it
mazzarella there  it's a fresh cheese then they
're sensitive I'm a sister I'm from the south
[Music] I don't
know it's
a little orangey
but maybe there are some chips stuff
if from the sabbatical
and then there's a mix that I don't
recognize that's like I see  some cheese
on top and what is a cutlet like it's
a cutlet made into pizza it's a
chicken cutlet made into pizza but you
keep your heads out
[Laughter]
seeing as she's joking it
seems like an atrocity but if it's boom
crazy people shoot up
I have to  understand better
that is, a good lace cutlet oh
well I thought worse much worse when I
saw it I was scared he wanted to
make it there are traditions in which
a thin slice is put on the chicken cutlet
but these are things that are
done at home in the family
hidden
and sometimes even a bit of tomato to make it
like pizza
but it takes a lot of courage let's say to
make it so
severe eat it means that good it's
good tiramisu
[Music]
now it's made rates that tiramisu is
very famous in Italy which debuts in
Italy also
goes  well
that is the mascarpone cream
and a little chocolate just sprinkled on top
here it seems like more or less everything is there it
can be done it's good but now it makes me
want to tell you the Italian measure
now the long awaited moment since
she is Neapolitan
we brought her  Neapolitan ice cream
ah yes
lepore nice here
in what sense is Neapolitan ice cream that
this because it already gives apart from the fact
that it is a lot of ice cream but then
because Neapolitan v I read that in the
past they made the Italian flag
with pistachio cream and
strawberry and  cherry
but it was always called Neapolitan
I think so the ice cream and
I take
a risk a mix
[Music]
ok
interesting and
I don't understand why it's Neapolitan because
we in Naples face the ice cream
though like in all of Italy
but the tastes are always these yes that the
costs of the Neapolitan are chocolate
vanilla and strawberry yes so you can go
to an old Neapolitan ice cream
you can only find it in the supermarket
this thing leaves me a bit perplexed
I don't know this this bike with this
combination I don't know what reja napoli
now in Italy
it would be the  time for a nice coffee
for you a cappuccino
then
here
you are
crazy but it really becomes crazy now
in Italy the coffee is an espresso only
after lunch that is after dinner it is small
this is a pint
and then not the cappuccino they won't let me
go back to Italy with  my passport if
I drink a cappuccino after lunch and after
dinner but it's a lot but why do I do it
because this is what I have to do
but in Italy cappuccino is drunk in the
morning for breakfast and I certainly
shouldn't have been thinking about dinner so I didn't
drink the cappuccino
but after drinking the prosecco free kylie minogue
let's go back to being at least a little
more Italian as we can
[Music]
