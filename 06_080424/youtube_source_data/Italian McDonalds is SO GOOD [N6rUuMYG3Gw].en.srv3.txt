Alright, Mr Z's gone.
The cat's away, the rats will play.
Time for McDonald's!
This is what the entire trip has been leading up to.
Okay, that is not what we're saying here.
It is the culinary highlight of this trip.
No, what are you talking about?
The ultimate crescendo.
I thought that was the carbonara pizza.
Yeah, that was actually pretty great.
- Okay.
- Oh yeah.
“Tocca per ordinaire”
[Tap to order]
Italian panzerotti.
I thought that was a type of tank.
That's a panzer, not a panzerotti.
You can get Parmesan!
Parmigiano-Reggiano snack!
Doesn't that mean it's the proper Parmesan?
Alright, we need to speak to our lawyers.
We are now promoting a competitor.
Yes, technically our restaurant empire collapsed.
Okay, I don’t think it collapsed, we just closed it.
This. We should get this.
Anything with Parmigiano-Reggiano in it, 
- Okay.
- I think we should get.
Is it just me or are the names longer here?
Especially when they insist on adding a Mc to everything.
What the heck is McCrunchy Bread?
Nutella filled croissant.
Alright, done.
47?
That's us.
Let's start. Breakfast.
Now this,
I was hoping it was going to be warm.
It's heavy.
Let's see what's inside.
Ohhhh yes.
Oh my gosh.
Oh! Dripped a little bit.
Nutella croissant.
Let's go for it.
It's like this croissant has a digestive system.
Right before you eat it.
I mean it's Nutella in a croissant.
Yeah, it turns out
croissant poo tastes exactly like Nutella.
And it's really good.
Next up, this.
Very curious about.
It looks like a Croque McDo,
which we were big fans of.
That's true.
Can you see the steam coming out of that?
That's hot!
That is disgusting.
The bread tastes like it's a week old!
And the cheese, literally,
I think that's just Dairylea cheese.
That does not live up to anything we've eaten.
Oh wait, what's this?
What does it say?
Why did you get me to read that?
You've read everything.
What does it say Ollie?
Wow.
Ohhh, yes!
This is the panzerotti.
The one with the really odd name.
Yes, panzerotti parmigiano reggiano,
or something.
It looks nothing like a tank.
It doesn't, it looks like an empanada.
- I don't know what that is.
- A little bit.
Mmm!
It's like a pizza pocket!
It's a calzoni-tino.
It's a mini calzone.
- It's quite good.
- Yeah.
- It's actually quite good.
- It’s very good.
It’s very good! Warm…
- It is very warm.
- Fluffy McDough.
The dough is very thick.
But, offset nicely with the cheese.
You can literally just have these for dinner.
Mr. Z would absolutely hate this.
But, that's a guilty pleasure right there.
That is a guilty pleasure. 
Burger time. It's burger time.
My selection.
Selecionati d'agio bastianic...
You're doing that thing when you speak Korean,
- Your brain shuts down mid-word.
- Selecionati.
Wow, there's a lot going on here.
Pancetta,  deep fried cheese.
There's a lot of salad.
You know it's special because 
it comes with a flag.
 
- A black label flag.
- Yeah, exactly.
Oh! 
There's a special sauce on the top.
Is it apple?
Some kind of sweet fruity sauce.
It might be apple sauce.
Before Ollie takes his bite, 
We just want to give a quick thanks
to Established Titles.
For making this whole Italian food tour possible.
You may have seen Mr. Z being referred to as 
Lord Z a few times over the course of this trip.
Lord Z!
The fastest Lord in the land.
Where are you taking us to my Lord?
We started this week with a pasty old mister,
And now we're with a majestic Lord.
Majestic indeed.
We worked with a company 
called Established Titles.
You can buy a plot of land 
on their estate in Scotland.
At least one square foot that 
entitles you to change your name.
Established Titles work with the global charities 
One Tree Planted and Trees for the Future.
And they will plant a tree 
for every Lord they bequeath.
So once again we are super thankful to Established 
Titles for making this crazy content possible.

Bye!
See you later Lord Z!
There's a lot of flavour in that.
That's actually good.
 That is actually good.
That is definitely the best bastianic I've had.
Look at the cheese.
Is that...
Mozzarella?
Breaded melted cheese.
I actually freaking love this.
The thing is, we've often said this 
about premium McDonald's burgers.
You rarely crave it right?
I don't know if I'd get cravings for this.
Because the quality is too good.
McDonald's, you want it to be crappy. 
Ronaldo, McDonaldino.
He is over delivering.
Alright, come on. McWrap.
What's it called?
McWrap la fumichato.
It looks like a chicken nugget in there.
I actually like that more than a burger.
No.
It's simple.
Josh, Josh you've lost touch.
You've lost touch.
Why?
- What is wrong with you? 
- What are you talking about?
What is wrong with you? 
Normally, you look inside a McWrap, yeah?
There's a tiny little bit of chicken.
It's mostly batter.
- I’m livid. I’m actually livid.
- It's mostly batter. It's just depressing looking. 
- That is stuffed full of chicken!
- I’m actually livid.
- Look how much chicken there is in that.
- This is what Mr. Z felt like,
When I told him I love carbonara pizza, isn’t it?
Have you noticed they only apply the Mc
to the American words?
Oh really?
When it's an Italian word
you don't get a Mc-whatever-that-is.
- I'm not going to read that out.
- McCrunchy Bread. 
Oh yeah, it's not McParmigiano.
And then on the wrap,  
Where's the top of the wrap?
McWrap.
The Mc is applied to the American word.
Alright, we need a little side of parmigiano-reggiano.
This is nuts.
A McDonald's packet of parmesan.
And instead of coming grated,
it literally comes in a little block.
Oh, you know what we should do?
We should do what the parmesan growers told us.
A little bit of balsamico.
Yes!
Two days ago we were eating what is probably 
the best parmesan in the entire world.
It feels a little bit insulting 
to call this the same thing.
Oh yeah, okay. Okay.
- It's like... a tribute act.
- I mean this is ridiculous.
This is so ridiculous.
It’s like a tribute act in a very small pub.
I would say more than a tribute act, 
it's like someone singing at a karaoke.
It's like someone going up to the mic
and everyone is like, oh please.
Just sit down.
It is technically the same song.
Technically.
If you want to eat parmigiano-reggiano,  
Don't come to McDonalds.
Alright, time for dessert.
Okay.
First up...
- McCrunchy Bread.
- Ah yes.
Our old friend.
- No Italian name for this.
- Nope.
Because they just couldn't resist
putting a Mc in there.
- This looks like...
- Ooh!
- It looks like an English muffin.
- An english muffin.
But it's stuffed full of Nutella and
I guess they don't want to call it a muffin?
Well they don't want to put English
anywhere near that.
Because it's just devaluing.
Give it a bite.
It does sound crunchy.
It is crunchy.
It's also maybe the most dry thing
I've ever eaten.
It's literally an English muffin
with Nutella in it.
And also, the Nutella to bread ratio
is not doing it any favours.
Zero Euros invested.
Next up, whatever the heck this is.
it is a Crema Al Caffe di Gianduia.
No Mc in there!
So you know it's legit.
Do you eat that with a spoon?
Are you sure you don't just drink that?
What the heck? What is in there?
Did you get any of the coffee at the bottom?
Oh my gosh Josh, Josh.
Just get a lump of that.
- There's lumps?
- Dig out of the bottom.
Oh yeah.
Just have it, just have it!
I want some more.
I want some more.
It's like a coffee chocolate gelato…something.
With little crispy chocolatey bits.
Little crunchy bits on the inside.
With like an espresso smoothie thing on the top.
How the hell is that so good?
I mean you could literally serve that
in a fine dining restaurant.
That is so good.
Mr Z. He doesn't know what he's missing.
What? This thing?
We don't even know what it's called.
I don't even know what he's missing.
I would come to Italian McDonald's just for that.
I would come to Italy just for that.
I mean there are a lot of other reasons to come,
just add it to the list.
Lord Z is going to watch this,
- Your head is on the block.
- That and carbonara pizza. Fricking smashing it.
Tiramisu.
Wow, there’s literally
just two sponges on the bottom.
Some cream and chocolate powder on the top.
Cheers.
The chocolate powder lined the entire roof of my mouth.
Yeah that's terrible.
That's genuinely disgusting.
An insult to the name Tiramisu.
That's the worst Tiramisu I've had, ever.
Including all the Tiramisu I've eaten in London.
- Honestly.
- Okay I need some more of this guy to wash that away.
That has been Ronaldo McDonaldino.
Oh, no.
Here in Ferrara.
I’m just gonna say it:
Italian McDonald's is better than French McDonald's.
Wow, I didn't know we were...
- Top of the European league table.
- …pitting European countries against each other.
Trying to compare and start beef.
We're in a good position to do that,
Because we're super popular as 
English people in Europe right now.
Let us know in the comments another McDonald's 
in Europe or indeed anywhere in the world.
Where's the best McDonald's?
I do want to answer that question.
I do feel a little bit sick.
Got some McRegret to look forward to.
In the meantime...
We'll see you JOLLY soon!
See you JOLLY soon.
It doesn't feel quite right to end this beautiful...
Italian food trip series on this note but...
It's too late now.
