i'm going to make you the perfect
italian tomato sauce
it's one of the building blocks of
italian food and if you're going to cook
well
you've got to know what the building
blocks are of any cuisine that you
choose to do
so it's a really really important thing
tomato sauce really typifies
italian food it's used in so many dishes
on pizzas
with pasta in ragus you know stews all
sorts of things
i'm sure you've all made a tomato sauce
before you all make tomato sauce
yeah i used to think i knew how to make
tomato sauce until one day i was
standing with some friends and i'd cook
for dinner we're in italy they've got
their italian friends there and i serve
up the pasta with tomato sauce on it
and i noticed that the wife was going
like this and i thought oh god what's
wrong there's something wrong with the
food you know
so i went racing over and i said what's
wrong what's wrong she said nothing i
said no i saw you going like this and
going
you know what's wrong with this he said
well not enough oil
you haven't cooked it long enough you
know it was one of those tomato sauces
that i thought i knew how to make until
you look at the pasta and you get that
watery
residue at the bottom of the night this
is how you make
tomato sauce the first thing i'm going
to do is chop two onions
this is a very simple one you can do all
sorts of other ones with all sorts of
other ingredients added but this is the
most simple
one of all and i think it's one of the
best so
i'm going to finely chop these this is a
rustic sauce
i'm not going to get too hysterical
about
chopping onions if i was in italy
watching
us
[Laughter]
are you sure see that in but
just chop it up it's just really not
going to matter i'm going to cook these
onions for
at least 10 minutes in a lot of oil so
they're going to melt the other thing i
want is
four cloves of garlic in here as well
so four cloves of garlic peel them
really quickly just by
smacking them with the side of the knife
like
that and that just
makes them pop out of their skin and
just chop these
up
that's all going to go in together okay
the first stage of making a tomato sauce
the first stage of making a risotto the
first stage of making a ragu or a stew
is this thing called the sofrito hugely
hugely important
this establishes the base of the flavor
base of the sauce
so i want some olive oil and i want
about
a little bit you know not too much okay
that's about right about 100 mls of
olive oil i'm always staggered
at the amount of olive oil that italians
use in their food
so this is the sofrito and we're going
to get that nice and hot
and then i'm going to turn it right down
and i'm going to give it 10 to 15
minutes
take your time over this the longer you
do this the better the sauce is going to
taste
i'm good i'll put a little bit of salt
in here at the moment but not too much
start to flavor it a little bit of
pepper and
as i say this is the most basic sort of
a sauce you can do
but they'd also put things in here if
you want to make it richer
you'd put a very finely diced carrot a
couple of sticks of celery really thinly
sliced and the onion the carrot the
celery
you've got what's called the odori the
aromatic things the things that give a
really nice
flavor to it but this is a really simple
one so
as i've said before i think the thing i
like about italian
food is their genius for making simple
things taste
like a lot more than what they are just
about there with this
it takes a very long time to make an
onion soft yeah
you've eaten dishes where you fried the
onion and it's still crunchy
i don't want any crunch in this onion i
want this onion to be melted
right this is almost ready for the next
thing which is the tomatoes
now don't be perturbed by the amount of
oil in there and don't think about
cutting it down
we'll put that in there so it's two cans
of crushed italian tomatoes
stir up bring it back to the boil
plenty of this in there as well
got two sorts of tomato things going on
here cans which are real tomatoes
sitting in juice so they've got a nice
tomato flavor
and this stuff this is puree tomatoes
which have been dried out
so that they get thick and pasty in
places like sicily calabria you can see
in the summertime big sort of big plates
outside with this tomato paste drying in
the sun
the other thing you'll find is passata
which is basically those same
canned tomatoes which have been whisked
through a pasata machine
which basically makes the core the pips
and the skin stay behind
and everything else is pureed and comes
out the other end pioneer well that was
my question whether you'd
taken the seeds out of the crushed
tomatoes or something
no no this is a rustic thing they would
never ever take the seeds out of the
tomatoes
if you're going to make a tomato sauce
it's got a scream tomato at you you know
or if you're going to make something
delicate it's got to scream i'm so
delicate actually
but whatever you're making has got to be
really clear and robust and
cranky taste buds up you know what do
you want people to say about your food
that's nice oh wow that's great
right so i'm just going to stir all this
and this is going to now simmer for
about 20 minutes
this also doubles as a bit like a
pizzeola sauce so pizzeola is a man who
makes pizzas
i'm going to use it for pasta and you
see the size of the pot
you need a really big pot for pasta
filled right up it's
because the the pasta is going to have
lots of room to swim
you don't want it all jammed up stuck
together like that and the other thing
is is anybody know what pasta water is
supposed to taste like
it needs to be as salty as the
mediterranean salty is the mediterranean
which is a very salty sea
so um i'm gonna put some salt in to that
water okay stir it up
and have a little taste
not enough salt i know
people freak out when you do this but
don't worry
if you don't do that when you're cooking
pasta if you don't have that water
properly
seasoned when you cook the pasta it's
going to taste like you made porridge
without salt or you're eating a boiled
egg with no salt you know
completely lacking all right let's just
see if this tastes right
almost there it's gotta taste like
you think about when you swallow a
mouthful of salt water when you're
swimming it's really salty
so this this makes the pasta taste good
don't put olive oil in the water how
incredibly wasteful
because what are you gonna do with this
water tip it down the sink
with your olive oil if you're worried
about your pasta sticking together
because you've got to keep it for a
little while after you've cooked it
put the pasta into a bowl put the olive
oil on the pasta and toss it up and
it'll stop it sticking
and you get to eat the olive oil which
is really good olive oil is expensive
you know
it's one of those things that you
treasure
so don't waste your olive oil by putting
it in the water if you're worried about
the pasta sticking when you put it in
the water you've got to stand there and
stir it
until it comes back to the boil once
it's boiling it won't stick
so it's time to put some pasta on
briskly boiling
pasta water there we know it's salty
enough and i've got some thin spaghetti
here
put that in there and stir it keep it
moving
until it comes back to the boil how will
i know when this is cooked anyone know
how do you tell when pasta is cooked
you take it out and bite it you bite it
taste it yeah it's got to be al dente
which means tender to the bite
a little bit of resistance you don't
want it completely mushy
and you don't want it raw obviously
italians will eat these
just a little bit rawer than kiwis like
it but you have to taste it to find out
you know that idea that some people
think you know it's cooked if you throw
it at the fridge and it sticks
don't do that it's a lot of rubbish
the difference in the flavor of the
pasta
if you salt the water properly is quite
extraordinary
it makes such a difference to your whole
dish
and it's not pasta until it's got the
sauce on it and it's mixed up
and then it's pasta if you're having
lunch with italians or having a meal
with italians
they always put the pasta into a big
bowl in the sauce and it's always
stirred up often at the table
but it's always stirred up before you
even you know get it
right that's boiling that simmering
that's just about done see the color of
this sauce
that's what it should be like you know
you get those insipid
sort of vaguely pale orange tomato
sauces
horrible horrible things cook like you
mean it everything should have very
clear flavors
it should be thick and jammy should be
like jam it should be like chutney you
know
shouldn't be in any way watery you don't
want that at all otherwise when you eat
it especially if it's on pasta you're
going to find that watery residue at the
bottom of the plate
which you don't want that at all it's
got a little bit of oil
floating on the top that's fine not
worried about that at all
i'm going to taste it though because i
want to i want to season it make sure it
has enough salt
it's good but it needs that magic
ingredient
so
it's good luckily this is just about
so let's find out uh you may not want to
do it like this
bare hands but the nerve endings went
years ago
you can just see a little tiny tiny
white core
in there and to me by the time i've
wrangled that out of the pot
into the colander out of the colander
got the sauce sorted out this is going
to be just
it's going to be fine right let's get
this out of here
if i was serving this i'd have two bowls
i have the bowl to mix it in the bowl to
serve it in
just put a little bit in
and some sauce
so this pasta is ready to eat serve it
up
in a pasta bowl get yourself a
microplane or a good grater put a little
bit of parmesan on it
it's nice we could just put some basil
on that though couldn't we
so just some basil leaves and the heat
of that i can smell the basil
already to me that's a meal glass of red
wine it's a great meal
you
