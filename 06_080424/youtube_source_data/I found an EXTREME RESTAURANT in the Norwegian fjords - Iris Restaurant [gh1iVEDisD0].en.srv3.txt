I take one look and think
how did I get myself into this?
It all started with a restaurant recommendation.
The next thing I know, I’m on this boat.
On this fjord.
Here in Norway.
The scenery is absolutely breathtaking of course,
but something keeps popping up in my mind.
That film from 2022.
The Menu.
That is our destination floating in the distance.
But first, we are told, a little stop over
to get to know each other.
On a sparsely populated island.
The soft meditation music in the background 
tells me that my experience is beginning.
It opens with a drink.
This is a cider from a company called Edel.
It was such a hit they made a business out of it.
I don’t drink cider too 
often, but this is incredible.
Our first snack honors nature’s diversity.
It’s a cone filled with vegetables, 
herbs and a citrus emulsion.
It’s light and crispy and very appetising.
Our second snack is a tribute to 
an old Scandinavian tradition.
It’s grilled brioche topped with 
a cream made from smoked cod roe
and grated scallop roe.
The apple cider really 
balances the smoky sea flavors.
Excellent pairing.
This has been great, but now it’s 
finally time for the main event.
First some introductions.
This is Nico from Denmark.
He is the front of house specialist 
responsible for the service side of things.
Nico’s wife is Anika Madsen.
She is the head chef.
Her first head chef role was at 
Roxie in the 5 star hotel Herman K.
Then in 2020, Anika moved to the 
restaurant Fasangarden in Copenhagen.
Here she has the freedom to 
create a menu led by sustainable,
seasonal ingredients from 
local farmers and fishermen.
It’s a concept she falls in love with.
A few years later she has the 
opportunity to do the same thing here
in the middle of nature.
She jumps at the chance.
Now, Nico and Anika live here, on this 
island with 5 other restaurant staff.
There are no road connections 
and it’s only accessible by boat.
This group seems committed, that’s for sure.
But then again, they’ve only 
been open a very short while.
Today is their 3rd day of business.
Ever.
So we are back on the boat.
The closer we get to this strange 
building, the more curious I get.
It was finished in 2022 as an exhibition 
center for the Norwegian aquaculture industry.
It’s 25 meters long and weighs 
more than twelve hundred tons.
More than 9000 steel plates 
cover it like fish scales.
It’s the world’s largest 
floating art installation.
and home to our restaurant for today.
Iris.
We arrive to the same comforting 
music we heard at the boathouse.
It’s slow and melodic, creating 
a calm, peaceful space.
That movie, The Menu, comes 
rushing back as the door closes.
Suddenly, we are in complete darkness.
No one says a word.
What’s going on?
I see things hanging down from the ceiling,
but I have no idea what’s happening.
Suddenly the video starts playing.
And soon, their mission becomes clear
to create a sustainable world through 
food in the service of nature.
The 18-course menu presents ideas to see 
our biggest food challenges in a new light
and focuses on the untapped 
potential of the ocean.
it’s time for our next snack 
and our first lesson in ecology.
The dish is called Uni-fication, 
with kelp and sea urchin.
Sea urchin is an invasive species 
that feeds on kelp forests underwater.
By eating more sea urchin, we can help 
the important kelp forests survive.
The host asks us to choose a hanging 
kelp cracker to unite with sea urchin.
It was salty and acidic with a great crunch.
I could eat this any time.
Then, a quick view that pinpoints the 
different producers that supply the restaurant. 
We are in Hardangerfjord, the 
second longest fjord in Norway. 
The suppliers are all from the area. 
It’s an amazing system that 
is connected only by water.
We are shown to our table.
The furniture and table 
settings are really beautiful.
Pure Scandinavian quality.
The wine list is premium, as you might expect.
My I eyes suddenly stuck on an item which 
I wanted to try for a very long time.
This was a special Krug clos du mesnil 2008.
and I also go with the wine pairing.
The first pairing is a 
champagne from Bonnet-Ponson.
They are a small producer from Chamery in France
who use only organic farming methods.
Our first course is called ‘Coat of Arms’
It’s mahogany clams, herb 
emulsion and Norwegian tomatoes.
It looks like a flowerbed and I feel a 
bit bad destroying this presentation.
The dish is rich and aromatic.
Tremendous flavors here.
“Feeding Future”
It starts with a showpiece 
of 4 sustainable proteins.
These will make the cream for our dish.
It’s Yeast, insects, mycellium and algae powder.
The breaded salmon is a ten out of ten.
I have never had this small size of salmon before.
Brilliant idea.
They use salt bravely here, 
and it’s bloody delicious.
“Colorblind”
It’s cheviche-style white salmon 
with birch sap and elderflower.
I am stunned.
This dish was so good.
The acidity is incredible.
It’s paired with a natural wine 
from the Auverne region of France.
This wine is aged the traditional way in amphora
and it has really strong notes of elderflower.
Well-matched.
“Next-level Neighbors”
  
It’s nordic blini with fresh shrimp, 
caviar and black currant leaves.
I love this dish.
There is something special about the shrimp.
The cold water fattens them up,
and fat means flavour.
The caviar wasn’t dominant, 
it was more like a spice.
I love this dish
It’s paired with another natural French wine.
I’m not big fan of these wines 
and I didn’t love this one either.
At the half-way point I can 
say the kitchen is strong.
They are consistent in exceeding my expectations.
The service side has still a room to grow.
Everyone is kind and enthusiastic.
The service can get clumsy at times.
And this means small things get overlooked.
There is a lot of weight on the service team.
I think with time they will grow 
to the level of the kitchen.
Let’s not forget this is 
only their third day open!
And what a challenge it must be to find 
people to work here in the far far away.
“From zero to hero”
It showcases two heroes found in nature.
The first is lumpsucker.
It’s a fish that cleans salmon.
The second is oyster mushroom.
It can clean up oil spills.
In this dish they meet with buerre 
blanc, pointed cabbage and new peas.
Very strong acid profile and good balance
I feel the kitchen is really putting on a show.
Next, we move to the very comfortable sofas.
Our next dish is made of ingredients 
sourced within 500 meters.
The idea is to be more aware 
of the food sources available.
70% of the earth is covered with water,
but only 2% of our calories come from the ocean.
This course is smoked Blue 
Mussels, seaweed and beach crab.
The plate is very interesting.
and then
VOILA
The light comes on.
Beautiful.
This is an intense and exciting dish.
I like the way chef Anika cooks so much.
She will win a lot of awards.
The pairing is Krug Grande Cuveé.
No words needed.
We are moving again, this time to the terrace.
We arrive to a grill party.
It’s like coming to an old friend.
The meat is already cooking on the 
fire, ice cold beer in the bucket…
This is something I absolutely didn’t expect.
We are told to sit back and relax for 10 minutes.
The atmosphere is friendly,
the view is stunning,
and the weather is beautiful.
it’s really easy to do that.
For our next course, we try authentic viking food.
Grilled flatbread and dried meat.
And we have a beer.
It’s a Lervig Peach Pilsner that combines 
the crisp beer with a hint of juicy peach.
This is a nice moment.
Our next course is called Weeds of the Sea.
Squid and cuttlefish numbers have 
been going up since the fifties.
They are called the weeds of the sea because 
they grow fast and adapt to changes quickly.
Here we have thinly sliced Norwegian 
cuttlefish cooked in dashi butter
with kelp and unripe strawberries.
This plate is beautiful.
I know I’m saying it over and over 
but this is very, very strong.
The depth of flavor, the technical skill,
this is perfect.
The pairing is from Alexandre Bain
It’s a natural white wine with 
mineral, fruity and salty notes.
Our next course is called Change of Heart
In this course they open our 
eyes to the world of wild game
as a way to fight climate change.
Did you know that reindeer and roebuck 
produce C02 levels 50 times lower than beef?
This dish features a tartar of reindeer 
heart, grilled leeks and pickled capers.
I’m speechless.
This chef cooks like very few I’ve seen.
Every dish is exciting.
Next we choose a blade.
The knife maker is a gentlemen in his 70’s
who finds wood in the nearby mountains 
and creates knife handles from it.
“Horn to hoof”
Our main course features reindeer again.
The first serving is baked tongue 
topped with shredded reindeer heart.
The texture is out of this world.
On the plate is reindeer fillet with fresh  
raspberries and a sauce of 
pepper and mustard seed. 
If I had to name a restaurant where 
I ate significantly better dishes,
I couldn’t.
It’s paired with an elegant 
pinot noir from Burgundy.
It comes from Domaine Remi Jobard.
This is an organic wine and all 
of the work is done by hand.
Our first sweet course is hazelnut ice cream 
and caviar with spruce shoots and pine.
Ice cream sandwich with caviar.
Bulls eye.
I would never have thought that 
this local thing can be this strong.
It’s paired with an IS Sider
This is a new trend of making cider 
with the same process as ice wine
Lots of sweetness together 
with a fantastic acidity,
lots of complex flavours.
Very good length and intensity.
The cider we had in the boat house was very good,
now we got a sweet wine from the same producer
Our next sweet course is a tribute to the great 
mountains we can see from the dining room.
They are called Malm and Melder.
The dish is a rhubarb sorbet 
with salted oat crumble.
The green coloring comes from pine.
It’s beautifully creative to show the 
topography of the mountains nearby.
The flavor is next level too.
The ice cider goes even better with this 
dish, the acids come together perfectly.
We also learn to speak like a Norwegian.
There is a famous saying
“Ut på tur, aldri sur”
It means
Out on a hike, never sour.
There are 20,000km of marked trails in Norway
and hiking is said to be 
nature’s best stress relief.
It’s back to the roof for a disgestif.
Chairman’s reserve rum from Saint Lucia
We still have one course to go.
It’s called Tribute to Rosendal.
It’s in honor of their closest neighbor,
the town of Rosendal.
Population: eight hundred and four.
This course is a pate de fruit 
with roses and wild forest berries.
It’s super sweet and intense.
Last but not least, we have the petit fours.
A small rum truffle with 
norwegian rum and bitter cocoa
and cake made from roasted almond 
flour, creme fraiche and black currant
The bitter balances nicely with the sweet cake.
Excellent finish to an amazing dining experience.
It’s only a matter of time before this 
place gets the attention of the world.
I htink all the lists and awards will be lined up.
From the boat trip to the light show
to the concept teaching sustainability,
this restaurant radiates unbelievable vibes.
Add this to a super-strong kitchen.
An outstanding audiovisual 
and gastronomic experience.
All I can say about Iris is
“Oh my god"
and that does it for this episode
