(upbeat music)
- Hello friends and
welcome to another video.
This week we're gonna be eating
at every celebrity chef's
restaurant on the Las Vegas strip,
at Giada's, Gordon's and Guy's, oh my.
Now, as some of you guys may know,
earlier last year we spent
two weeks in Las Vegas,
speed running staying
at every single hotel
on the Vegas Strip.
And while we were there
we did a lot of things
like visiting the Mandalay Bay Aquarium.
Oh he's a big boy.
- He's a big one.
- [Safiya] Riding the terrifying Big Shot
on top of the Strat.
(screams)
(laughs)
And playing "Twilight Zone" mini golf
in the basement of Bally's.
But we also had a lot of good eats.
- It was a good day.
Yeah, more, bring it.
- Vegas is generally known as a place
with a lot of really great,
though sometimes expensive restaurants.
And in the same way that different casinos
try to attract customers to
stay there with their clubs,
shops and shows, they also try
and compete with each other
as to who has the more
marquee places to dine.
And in sort of the same way
that different famous performers
have Vegas residencies,
high profile celebrity chefs
have their own signature
Vegas restaurants.
I can take a chi latte by Guy Savoy.
This has been somewhat discussed
on this channel before,
but Tyler and I are big Food Network fans.
Beyond the classics, we love
"The Great Food Truck Race".
- Let's get rolling!
(cheers)
- [Safiya] As well as "Food Network Star",
which is basically like "Top Chef",
except you have to be good at cooking
and good at being a TV personality.
- It is the goodness, my friends.
- And we also love other food related,
but not actually on the Food Network shows
like all of Gordon Ramsey's content.
I'm a particular sucker for any of the
making over failing business ones.
- The hell is that?
Looks like a (beep) flip flop.
- Which makes us pretty big
fans of a lot of the names
in the celebrity chef world.
So while we were in Vegas,
we wanted to try and hit every
celebrity chef's restaurant
on the strip, get a little
taste of what they're serving up
and see who generally comes out on top.
"Beat Bobby Flay"?
Well, they're all certainly gonna try.
Now the first question we encountered
when trying to make our list
of restaurants to hit was
what is a celebrity chef?
Because there are a lot
of restaurants in Vegas
that boast celebrity owners.
You have people who are
known for other things,
like the Jonas Brothers who
just opened up a new restaurant.
Are they playing Jones Brothers right now?
No, it's Charlie Puth, I
think, is that allowed?
And then you also have
people who are known widely
for a single meme like Salt
Bae, who also has a restaurant.
So when we cast a wide net
to try and make this list,
we ended up with about
33 places we had to hit,
which was a bit crazy when we considered
that we also had to film
about three hotels a day
for our other videos.
So we decided to narrow
it down to just chefs
who have been the central
characters in their own show,
movie, or long form content series.
So they are both media
personalities as well as top chefs
and also the content should
be about them being chefs
or running restaurants.
So unfortunately the
Jonas Brothers are out.
We also decided to just do
one restaurant per chef,
as a lot of chefs on
this list have multiples.
Gordon Ramsey has like
eight restaurants in Vegas
and I feel like it's a whole other video
just to go to all of his
and then rank them against each other.
And in the end we ended up
with a list of about 12 spots
to hit, which was more doable.
Now a quick note here,
most of these restaurants
are pretty expensive.
In general, food on the Vegas
strip can get pretty pricey,
see $70 Johnny Rockets order.
- That's Vegas pricing.
- That's so crazy, right?
And a lot of these places
are fine dining restaurants
and then when you add on
the famous name upcharge,
there's even more of a bump.
We will note when things are
even pricier than the rest
or when things are more reasonable,
but I just wanna establish
that we think that these prices
are a little eye popping and
we don't usually eat like this.
Also, in general, we wanted to
try a decent spread of things
in each restaurant.
So just a heads up, we
did end up over ordering
at a lot of these places and
taking the rest for later.
But with that, let's dine.
Now, first up on our list
was David Chang's Momofuku
restaurant at The Cosmopolitan.
- [Tyler] Thar she blows.
- Oh yeah.
David Chang is a famous
chef and restaurateur
who opened up his first
Momofuku Noodle Bar in 2004
and it became so successful
he was able to open up
multiple iterations of
Momofuku's around the world.
- A couple teaspoons of
salt, some black pepper,
and a couple hours of don't
(beep) worry about it.
- [Safiya] He also started his
own food exploration series
on Netflix called "Ugly Delicious".
- I'm okay making really ugly food.
This is basically one of the
ugliest dishes I've ever made.
- [Safiya] As well as the docu-series,
"The Next Thing You Eat" on Hulu.
I think this is his main
restaurant in Vegas.
- Well, you can't trust those DJs.
(laughs)
- [Safiya] Though he
does also have a stall
in this food hall at The Cosmopolitan
and is a co-founder of Milk
Bar with Christina Tosi,
which also has a location in The Cosmo.
- Nothing gets me more worked
up than goddam pumpkin pie.
- [Safiya] And the
ambiance of the restaurant
is kind of like a bait and switch.
The front area is a narrow wooden room,
but then when you walk through it,
you are let out into a huge
open dining area in the back
with high ceilings and
large windows with views
out onto the strip.
All right, I can see the Paris behind you.
It's the other side.
There's also some cool art in there
as well as notably a
high-tech Japanese toilet,
which we were so excited about
that Tyler
(bell dings)
apparently got some footage of it.
- They got a lot of good stuff.
- I'm excited.
Momofuku's cuisine is
generally described as
contemporary Asian American
and we basically decided to order
a couple of bowls of noodles
as well as some signature small plates.
Now part of David Chang's
brand is pork belly buns,
so we of course had to order a couple.
Whoa.
Those are huge!
And I think it's safe
to say these were good,
sweet, rich and warm.
- That is so soft.
- [Safiya] But they
weren't the standout dish
from our visit.
We got another signature item,
which our server dubbed a must try,
the raw tuna with foie gras on top of it,
which is kind of like a fancy
cuisine mashup kind of dish,
which David Chang is
also kind of known for.
- So it's like what the
(beep) are you eating?
You know what I mean?
- Now foie gras was a new new one for me.
It's made of duck liver,
which just off the bat
sounded pretty intimidating,
but it wasn't so bad.
It kind of tastes like cheese.
- [Tyler] Yeah, the goose
liver is very cheesy.
- They shave it really
finely over the tuna,
so the texture is a non-issue
and it's just kind of rich,
savory and oily.
It might be because it
looks kinda like cheese
that I think it tastes like cheese,
but I think it tastes like cheese.
The pine nuts are good
in there though too.
For our mains, we got the
ginger scallion noodles
with chicken and the truffle
ramen with a poached egg,
which we figured we should
try because it was $30 more
than the other ramen dish.
I'm guessing that's the
truffle down the middle.
Truffle can be kind of an overpowering,
earthy mushroom-esque flavor,
so the broth did end up mostly
just tasting of truffle.
- It's kinda like when you
have like a truffle burger
or like a truffle fry in noodle form.
Right?
So like.
- It's just truffle.
But Tyler really did
like the noodle itself,
nice and springy, as he said.
- [Tyler] I sort of like
accidentally like shotgun
my truffle noodles.
Sorry guys, I was supposed to
get some B-roll of my noodles
and I ate 'em.
- We did also get some non
signature things, mostly sides.
We love spicy cucumber.
And these were unexpected bangers,
in particular, the Brentwood
corn was out of this world.
- What are you doing?
(laughs)
- I'm trying to feed you the corn.
It was very fresh and smokey
with a little bit of salty cheese
and a little tangy sauce on it.
The sauce tastes like a bougie version
of the Taco Bell quesadilla sauce.
- Oh, I sent it this way.
(laughs)
- We also ordered a yuzu lemonade,
which was randomly very good.
Oh, that's amazing.
It's enhanced, that's enhanced lemonade.
Yuzu is a citrus fruit from East Asia
that actually popped up
a few times on our trip.
- Yuzu, man, a lot of
yuzu action on this trip.
- [Safiya] I agree everyone's into yuzu.
But in this instance,
it really just deepened
the lemonade flavor.
- It taste like a delicious bath bomb.
- Now as for our super fast
wrap up of the restaurant
so that we can get onto
the next place on our list,
we liked Momofuku a lot.
Is that the proper way to
eat noodles, outta my hand?
Amazing corn, killer noodles.
Maybe don't spring for the truffle
unless you definitely like truffle.
But the yuzu lemonade, once again.
- Slaps.
(laughs)
- It does.
- It's (beep) good.
- Now next up on our list was
Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen
at Caesar's Palace.
- [Tyler] According to sin and cuisine.
- [Safiya] And Gordon Ramsey
is probably one of the most
recognizable chefs on this list,
because he's made such a
name for himself in TV.
- They got it wrong on the menu.
It's not a crab cake, it's a crap cake.
- [Safiya] Like with "Kitchen
Nightmares", "Master Chef",
and of course "Hell's Kitchen",
which is a cookoff elimination
show where chefs compete
to become the head chef of a restaurant.
- It's (beep) raw.
(dramatic music)
- [Safiya] Besides being
an accomplished chef
and restaurateur, he's
also of course known
for his brash personality
and prolific profanity.
- Listen, listen, listen, listen.
(beep) up, (beep) up, (beep)
up, (beep) up, get out!
- [Safiya] As we mentioned earlier,
Gordon has a ton of other
restaurants on the strip
like Gordon Ramsey Steak,
Gordon Ramsey Burger,
Gordon Ramsey Fish and Chips,
Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill.
- [Tyler] The other
Gordon Ramsey restaurant.
- But we figured Hell's
Kitchen seemed the most
themed around his content,
so we picked this one.
All right, ready to head into
H-E double hockey stick's kitchen?
(laughs)
Hell's Kitchen is actually
in its own free-standing
structure outside the front
entrance of Caesar's Palace.
And once you get inside,
you are immediately hit
with a little section
of Gordon merch and a digital Gordon
who greets guests as they walk in.
Past that is the main dining
room, which is pretty large
and if you look carefully,
has a lot of devil pitchforks
hidden throughout.
They're all like back there.
There are a bunch of
pitchforks back there.
And is open to the kitchen,
which is where I think they
literally filmed the show.
And the cuisine seems to be
kind of general fine dining
with a few signature
Gordon dishes thrown in.
Unfortunately, idiot sandwich
doesn't seem to be on the menu.
- [Tyler] That's a missed opportunity.
- What are you?
- An idiot sandwich.
- We kind of ended up ordering
what was on the signature tasting menu,
plus a few other things.
Tomato burrata salad.
Fresh, never frozen scallops.
Most of these were pretty good,
with the exception of the scallops.
We're taking you inside
the scallop here, people.
The scallops themselves
were nicely cooked,
but the green sauce here is pea puree
and the kind of bitter pea
taste was pretty overwhelming.
- There's a lot of pea in there.
- It's very pea-y.
And maybe they agreed
because they've since changed
their scallop dish.
These might just be decorative peas.
Let me ignore the peas.
The burrata salad was very cool and juicy.
Look at that ratio.
And I really liked the
cup of mushrooms I got.
I'm not sure what this stuff
on top is, I don't need it.
I like the mushrooms just by themselves.
But the thing you all and we all came for
was the Wellington.
Are you ready for the Beef Wellington?
- Well me up.
- Where's the Wellington?
I'm getting nervous.
- Like hell, Gordon has branded
around the Beef Wellington
throughout his career.
Not the Beef Wellington magnet.
It's a traditional British
dish that is basically
a filet steak coated
in a mushroom stuffing
and then wrapped in puff pastry and baked.
- [Tyler] All right I'm gonna
scoop it through the potato
a little bit.
- [Safiya] And Tyler loved this thing.
- It's very fluffy.
- [Safiya] Fluffy?
- [Tyler] It's more pastry than I thought.
- Ah.
- You gotta try it.
- To be fair, this is the
kind of thing Tyler likes.
He likes meat pies and stuff like that.
Tyler would've done
well in medieval Europe.
- Oh, yeah.
- Meat pie central, baby.
- [Tyler] Except for my asthma.
- And the fact that you need contacts.
But between the two of us,
we thought that the Beef
Wellington lived up to the hype.
The meat was pretty tender
and the mushroom paste was
very smooth and savory.
Whatever that layer is in
between the pastry and the beef,
that's very good.
Now we didn't realize
this when we ordered it,
but apparently the sticky toffee pudding
is also a Gordon signature.
I think it's based off
of his mom's recipe.
What?
And this ended up being pretty S-tier.
That's like the best toffee,
butterscotchy-y thing
I've ever tasted in my
life, that's amazing.
- [Tyler] Alright, lemme try, lemme try.
- [Safiya] Up to that point,
I had thought my meal was quite good,
but not mind blowing and
this dessert blew my mind.
I need more of that.
- [Tyler] You're trying
to speed me along here.
- [Safiya] Yeah, can
you go faster, please?
It's super sweet, melty,
gooey, props to Gordon's mom.
- That is so good.
Now that I have the spoon in my hand,
I'm going right back in.
You got the camera, I got the spoon.
- How dare you.
Tyler is legitimately just eating this,
so I'm gonna have to put the camera down
if I want another bite.
Now overall, we enjoyed
our experience here,
at least somewhat for the novelty,
but I would definitely bring
another Gordon fan here
to try the toffee pudding.
If loving that is illegal, lock me up.
That's amazing, what the hell?
And possibly buy a Beef Wellington magnet.
It's not a want, it's a need.
Now next up on our list was
Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak
at the Mirage.
- This challenge really epitomizes
what I think about food.
Simple things have to be done right.
- [Safiya] Tom Colicchio
is I think best known
for being the head judge
of the long-running
competition show "Top Chef" on Bravo.
- In this business one day
you're in, the next you're out.
- [Safiya] That's not "Top Chef".
But he has hosted and appeared
in other content as well.
- How about we play a
little game of chicken?
- [Safiya] Besides being
an accomplished chef
and restaurateur, I also read
an article that called him
a master with the meat, so
with that what you will.
- That's the way I do it.
That's not the way I do it.
- Well this is like the
first one that we've gone to
that is a steakhouse.
- So you have to get a steak.
- We gotta get streak.
- [Safiya] And I think he
has two restaurants in Vegas.
He also has Craft Steak at the MGM Grand.
But because we already
had multiple restaurants
to visit over there, we went for this one,
which is right in the
central atrium of the Mirage
next to the casino floor.
And it also has a bit of
a hidden back area concept
as there's this whole
big dining room back here
kind of behind the waterfall
in the middle of the hotel.
Yeah, there's a whole thing back here.
- Yeah.
- So it's sort of like you're dining
in a little tropical
bungalow, which is nice.
I am like lost in the
jungle right now, aren't I?
(laughs)
And as we mentioned,
Tom mostly focuses on steakhouse classics
with some seafood thrown in,
though they do note that
they cook their meats
on a white oak open fire, fancy.
On the seafood side, we did
get the raw yellowtail crudo.
- [Tyler] Yeah, that's
a pretty presentation.
If you think about it, like a
"Top Chef" presentation's big,
right?
Is that the one they put
their hands up, right?
- They all do that.
- Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.
- Which looked great, but tasted okay.
A little too much skin for my taste.
And on the steak side,
because of course we had to get a steak,
we ordered the bone-in ribeye.
We asked, that's their top selling steak.
And this clearly was a high end steak.
- It's damn good.
- It wasn't too thick or too rich,
so it was pretty easy to eat
and you could kind of taste
the char from the open flame actually.
I like how smokey it is.
- [Tyler] It's very smokey.
- [Safiya] However, I have to be honest,
we don't know a lot about
how to judge good steaks.
There are people out there who
are like steak connoisseurs
and can describe subtle differences.
And we are more like if a
steak meets a minimum standard,
it's good, but we can judge other things.
And we found that the real
standouts were the sides
and the free stuff, the fries, awesome.
Okay, I snuck a fry, they're amazing.
- [Tyler] It's pretty incredible.
- [Safiya] They're like
gourmet McDonald's fries.
- Yeah, they are.
- The mixed green salad, beefy.
That cucumber could eat your mom.
The complimentary rolls?
Whoa, delectable.
Those look like luscious butt cheeks.
And the chill tomato
gazpacho was a standout dish
for the entire trip, it was tangy.
There were little quinoa pieces in there
that made it kind of crunchy.
And there were also large
pieces of what I thought
were very firm cucumber.
But upon further inspection,
there's watermelon in there.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
Which was genius.
It was sweet, crisp,
watery, very top shelf.
Get it?
Like "Top Chef".
- [Tyler] You look like
you're telling a story
on "Are You Afraid the Dark" right now.
- It's watermelon.
Overall, we had a good time.
I would come back for the gazpacho
and the bootylicious
rolls, whoa, what the heck?
But unfortunately, the
Mirage is set to be replaced
with a giant hard rock
guitar shaped casino,
so I might not get the chance.
Now the next restaurant on our list was
Jose Andres' Bazaar Meats at the Sahara.
- Hello people, I am Jose Andres.
Oh yeah.
- [Safiya] Jose Andres
is a famous Spanish chef
who's been credited with helping
popularize the tapas style
small dish dining concept in America
during the nineties and 2000s.
- Let's go to the kitchen.
- [Safiya] As his restaurants
in the US became more popular,
he started becoming more
famous in Spain as well
and got his own show on Spanish TV.
- The pasta obviously was
invented in Spain, period, yes.
- [Safiya] He's also been
featured in a documentary film
about his nonprofit World
Central Kitchen on Disney Plus.
And he also has a new Discovery plus show
coming out as well.
- It's like an art piece.
- It's an art piece.
- And Jose Andres actually
has a lot of restaurants
on the Vegas strip, but
we chose Bazaar Meats
because it combines some elements
of the Spanish tapa style
with cuts of rare meat
and some of his out there,
experimental molecular gastronomy dishes.
What is a caviar cone and do we need it?
The restaurant itself
is like a long dark room
with bizarre, almost
hunting lodge type decor.
- [Tyler] A lot of antlers.
An alligator.
- Also the kitchen is
open to the dining room
and so a lot of smoke from
different grilling meats
fills the air.
The thing is is it just,
it smells so good in here,
it's hard to get over it.
Now there's a lot on this menu
and a lot of our choices
were directed by our server.
And since most of it is tapas style,
we ordered a lot of
stuff including a smoking
cotton candy mojito because
we saw someone else get it.
Is that how you drink it, Tyler
you just stick your head in it?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
- [Safiya] The majority of dishes
fall into three main categories.
The raw stuff like the bison carpaccio,
this is literally meat by the foot.
This is how you do it.
As well as the Kobe airbreads,
which are like hollow
crackers with raw meat outside
and liquid cheese inside.
- [Tyler] This one's like a cheese steak.
- [Safiya] A raw cheese steak?
The tiny stuff like this
deconstructed caprese salad.
- [Tyler] Well it's the size of the plate
that does it for me.
- And the caviar cones,
which at the risk of
sounding highly unrelatable,
I actually thought were pretty good.
Kind of tastes like a
wonton with cheese in it.
Nice, crunchy and salty.
And this one even had
some gold flakes on it.
- I love gold.
Can I eat it?
- Yes you can.
- That's delicious.
- [Safiya] And then we have
the experimental stuff,
like these deconstructed
olives, which were pretty crazy.
- [Server] Now this right
here is an experience.
- [Safiya] They serve you real olives
and then like the essence of an olive
in a little sack of water.
It looks like an egg yolk.
- It is Gudetama-esque.
- Oh my god, oh my god,
it's sliding around.
- All right,
go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Just slide it in?
- Slide it in.
Slide it down your gullet.
- Which you pop in your mouth
and kind of tastes like the
aftertaste of a veggie pizza.
If pizza was water.
It was pretty good.
Obviously a pizza with olives, but still.
The other marquee
experimental thing we got
was the foie gras cotton candy,
which as we mentioned before is duck liver
that is in this case
somehow spun into sugar.
- Cheers.
- One bite, one bite.
- Cheers, all in one bite, yeah, ready?
- [Safiya] I thought this was interesting.
- [Tyler] Cheesy.
- The cotton candy part
itself was almost just like
normal cotton candy,
but there was a bit of
more solid foie gras
in the middle of it that
kind of took me by surprise.
It was like cotton candy until it wasn't.
It was almost like a pad
of butter in the middle.
I don't know if I liked it, I think.
We did also order a very
small amount of a rare cut
of Wagyu beef, which was
cooked on a hot stone
next to our table.
I feel a little wined and dined right now.
I feel very like catered
to, you know what I mean?
So the whole experience
was very impressive.
- [Tyler] It was the
certificate of authenticity
that did it for you?
- Yeah, exactly.
It's the certificate for me.
And it was actually a good thing
that we got so little of it
because it was extremely rich,
so I don't think we could
have eaten much more.
- It's the least laborous
beef I've ever eaten.
It just melts.
- [Safiya] We did also get
an assortment of desserts.
What the heck?
- [Tyler] I'm a little
rattled by how good they look.
- [Safiya] Which weren't
that experimental,
but they were incredible.
- [Tyler] That went straight to the face.
- [Safiya] Now we did say we
would mention if a restaurant
was more expensive than the others
and that restaurant is this one.
I think partially because
it's fancy small plates
and partially because
it's cuts of rare meats,
but I would come back
if someone else was picking up the bill
for the caviar cones and the desserts.
- It's the tits.
- [Safiya] Now next up on
our list was Bobby Flay's
Bobby's Burgers at Harrah's.
- [Tyler] Bobby's Burgers.
- [Safiya] That's where we're going!
Bobby Flay is a longtime
Food Network personality.
- [Tyler] There he is, man with the plan.
- [Safiya] Having cooked and judged
on like a million different
Food Network shows.
- Enough said.
(laughs)
- But he might be best known for his own
personal competition
show, "Beat Bobby Flay".
- What happened?
- I just shut his oven off.
(laughs)
- [Safiya] And though
he does a lot of stuff,
he specializes in Cajun
and southwestern cuisine specifically.
- Woo.
- It's hot.
It's a hot sauce.
- [Safiya] Now some drama.
Before the pandemic, Tyler
and I had visited Vegas
and seen Bobby Flay's Mesa
Grill at Caesar's Palace,
which is his OG restaurant
brand that he opened in New York
in the nineties.
And for some reason we were
very excited by this idea.
- [Tyler] Mesa, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.
- But lo and behold, when we
returned to Vegas this year,
it seemed that Bobby had
replaced his iconic Mesa grill
with a coastal Italian restaurant, Amalfi
and Tyler and I felt irrationally betrayed
that we would never get
to eat at Mesa Grill.
I had no impulse to Beat Bobby Flay
until you removed Mesa Grill.
Now I wanna beat him to a pulp.
So we could not bring
ourselves to go to Amalfi.
- [Tyler] Look, it looks super nice.
- [Safiya] No, don't say that.
- [Tyler] But in terms of decor.
- Literally never speak to me again.
I can't believe you said that.
Instead we decided to go
to one of Bobby Flay's
Bobby's Burgers locations
and Bobby does seem to be
opening a lot of these,
so they seem to be a point
of emphasis for him as well.
- [Tyler] People like Bobby's Burgers.
- It's a decently casual
walkup burger spot,
which I would describe as a
more gourmet seeming Five Guys
or Shake Shack.
Oh, should I have gotten the fries?
- [Tyler] Go back and get us some fries.
- We gotta get some fries.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
And his menu is of course mostly burgers,
but like with interesting toppings.
I should wait.
His Crunch Burger is trademarked,
so of course we had to get that.
And the secret of this one
is that they put a bunch of
potato chips on the burger.
That did sound crunchy, I'm not gonna lie.
The crunch heard around the Harrah's.
But beyond that, it is pretty tasty.
That tastes very bad for me.
(laughs)
I think because of the lack of vegetables,
it is a bit heavy feeling
like it's meat, cheese,
bread and salty chips.
It's a knockout.
It almost has like a Hamburger
Helper, mac and cheese vibe.
The second thing we got
was the brunch burger,
partially because it rhymed and
partially because we thought
it was just an egg sandwich.
(bell chimes)
Are you gonna lift it up?
Oh, hello there.
- [Tyler] That is a beautiful little egg.
- As big egg fans, we did like it.
Once again, it's like very cozy.
But in my opinion it was sorely lacking
a little crisp tomato or maybe
a raw onion or something.
Absolutely no vegetables at all,
not a single one to be found.
That said, the fried
chicken sandwich we got
was really good.
The textures in here
were a little more varied
with some crispy cabbage slaw
and a little vinegary pickle.
There's something a
little spicy in the slaw,
which is giving it to me.
- The pickle is out this world.
- And all that helped balance
out the fried chicken itself
for a great sandwich experience.
Something a little fresher about this one.
Probably the vegetables.
- Yeah.
- [Safiya] Okay, so it's not
completely fair to compare
Bobby's Burgers to the other
fine dining restaurants,
but overall I thought
some of his burger ideas
were pretty interesting.
- [Tyler] Would you say that
it has the trademark edge
of Bobby's personality?
- Yes.
- Shut up.
- And these three burgers
were actually less expensive
than the three chicken sandwiches
we bought from Johnny Rockets.
So even though it's not
cheap, it is cheaper.
Now next up on our list
was Buddy Valastro's
Pizza Cake restaurant, also at Harrah's.
We're knocking out a bunch
of celebrity chef restaurants
like right now.
Buddy V is more commonly
known as the Cake Boss.
- There's a lot of cake here, man.
- [Safiya] Famous from
the long-running TLC show
that chronicles the crazy
creations he and his staff make
at their family run Carlo's
Bakery in Hoboken, New Jersey.
- That's how you do a dragon cake
Hoboken style.
(bell chimes)
Hoboken style.
(bell chimes)
Hoboken style, baby.
(bell chimes)
- [Safiya] And like we
mentioned in our hotel video,
Buddy V is kind of taking over the strip.
- Big time, baby.
(bell chimes)
- In addition to having a number of 24/7
cake vending machines all over the place,
He has a Buddy's
Ristorante at The Venetian,
a Boss Cafe at The Linq
and then a Buddy's Jersey
Eats also at The Linq.
Another Buddy Valastro restaurant.
- [Tyler] He's got a lot of juice.
- [Safiya] I chose Pizza Cake specifically
because it sounded more cake
oriented and also because
there was a time where Buddy actually made
a giant pizza cake on the show.
- Now that's a pizza cake.
Woohoo!
- [Safiya] Pretty impressive.
- [Tyler] Do you think the name Pizza Cake
is supposed to be like piece a cake?
- Oh, that's pretty good.
Pizza Cake is right next to
the Harrah's casino floor
and is pretty open to
the rest of the hotel.
Let's make some dough!
That's what he's making here in Vegas.
And as the name suggests,
they serve different pizzas by the slice
as well as slices of cakes,
cookies and cannolis.
Whoa, what should we do?
- I dunno.
- [Safiya] Already weighed
down by Bobby's Burgers,
we skipped past the pizza and
went straight for dessert.
We ordered a slice of the rainbow cake,
which disappointingly did come
out of the vending machine.
I've never had cake like this before.
- [Tyler] What, vacuum sealed?
- So I guess we could have just gone
to one of the vending machines,
but it was pretty good.
The frosting was a little
too sweet for my taste,
but the cake part itself
was really light and fluffy
and a little eggy.
Let's carve out the frosting.
- Yeah.
Elightened thinking.
- [Safiya] We also got a slice
of these s'mores cookie cake.
Oh my god there are
teddy grahams on there.
- [Tyler] That's what sold it to me.
- [Safiya] Which I had gotten
because it seemed the most
like a cake pizza.
- Marshmallows, teddy
grahams, chocolate, good!
- The cookie itself was nice
and the use of teddy grahams
was kind of inspired.
But my one gripe was that they once again
used a lot of really sweet frosting.
Is there icing on there?
I feel like there doesn't need to be.
- No.
- And then
we also got a cannoli,
which was excellent.
Here it is.
The shell was nice and crispy
and the cream filling was not too sweet.
It was that perfect kind of
light cream cheesy flavor.
That's my favorite.
If I were Buddy, I would
be vacuum sealing these
and putting them in the
vending machines too.
How's it going over there, cannoli boy?
- Bigger bite than I was
expecting, welcomed though.
- Really good, right?
- Really good.
- [Safiya] Once again, it's
not that fair to compare this
to other fine dining restaurants,
but as a casual spot
next to the casino floor,
I thought this place was pretty fun.
The cannoli was the tits
and you do have to tip
your hat to Buddy V.
He's building an empire
and there's nothing any
of us can do to stop him.
- You're always eating
on the job, come on,
get back to work.
- Later that same day,
thankfully a few hours later,
so we had some time to digest,
we headed over to Guy Fieri's
restaurant at the Linq.
First impressions of The
Linq, smells like barbecue.
Guy Fieri's restaurant?
Right there.
Coincidence?
I think not.
Quick disclaimer, I say Guy Fieri's name
like 85 different ways in this video,
I apologize and hope I am
saying it correctly now.
- Now what comes rolling
down the driveway for dinner,
but this, the super duper weenie wagon.
- [Safiya] Now Guy Fieri,
with his off the hook
California cuisine was
actually an early winner
of Food Network Star back in
2006 and has since then become
one of the most recognizable
faces of the network.
- Wow, that's good.
The sausage ratio to this is outstanding.
- [Safiya] He's known for his
iconic style, frosted tips,
rough and tumble vibes,
and for being the self-proclaimed
mayor of Flavortown.
- Are we in Flavortown right now?
- I am at customs.
(laughs)
I am crossing the border.
You know what this is?
This is the Punch Bowl at the
Flavortown high school prom.
- We were also wearing
these coordinated, flaming
bowling shirts in celebration
of going to his restaurant.
So we were pumped.
I'm going to Flavortown
and no one can stop me.
I think this is his only
restaurant in Vegas,
though he does seem to
operate a Flavortown Kitchen,
which is a delivery only ghost kitchen.
I guess that answers my
question as to why this place
isn't called Flavortown.
- [Tyler] It's Guy Fieri's Vegas.
- That's an awful name.
But I still think he could
consider Flavor Sin City
or Flavortown Two.
Two Flavor Two City.
- Flavor Seven.
- Yes.
And he's serving up saucy
twists on American comfort food
with a lot of pretty crazy sounding names.
The Trashcan nachos are
one of his signature dishes
that we had to try, ah!
And they were pretty impressive
in terms of presentation,
quantity and tang.
- There's a lot of flavor.
That pickled onion's not messing around.
- [Safiya] The twist with
these nachos is that they have
barbecue sauce all over them.
- It's really sweet.
- It's all barbecue, baby.
Which is clearly one
of guy's staple moves.
As with all nachos,
they eventually cool down
into just a mound of stuff.
Is it sacrilege to eat this with a fork?
- [Tyler] It might be necessary.
- [Safiya] But it was
still pretty good to eat,
just as unidentifiable lumps.
Another thing we noticed was
that Guy is pretty generous
with his portion sizes.
Okay, a cheesecake just swung
by, it does look amazing.
- [Tyler] It's called
the Cheesecake Challenge.
- Like with this Bloody
Mary that we ordered
because Tyler's mom told us we had to.
Okay giant.
Which came with a huge
skewer of waffle fries
and an entire half of a jalapeno on top.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
My Tatted-Up Turkey
burger was one of the more
terrifying dishes I've ever eaten.
I don't know how to approach this.
The bun was tiny, but the
patty and fixings were huge.
Ha!
And the flavor almost knocked me over.
What am I tasting there?
(laughs)
There was ground Turkey, lettuce.
- [Tyler] That looks like
salsa on the left side there.
- [Safiya] I think some
salsa fell outta my burger.
And smokey gouda cheese.
Not bad, just powerful.
I asked for a trip to
Flavortown, he's taken me there.
And to end on a high but still large note,
the Big Dipper sandwich
was, according to Tyler,
one of the best things he
ate on our entire trip.
Napkin needed, napkin needed.
- That is amazing.
- [Safiya] It's kind of
like a half cheese steak,
half french dip love child
of a roast beef sandwich.
And Tyler wanted me to
specifically mention
that the hokey bread was very porous
and therefore very good
at soaking up the sauce.
- I mean that's really important
when it comes to this kinda
sandwich is the bread.
- [Safiya] Now we had a blast here,
mostly because the vibes were just good.
- [Server] I like your guys' shirts.
- [Safiya] Thank you.
And though some of the food terrified me,
I would come back here with
four to five more people
so we could take on the
Cheesecake Challenge,
because it looks good,
we just need backup.
Next up on our list was
Giada De Laurentiis'
eponymous Giada restaurant
at The Cromwell.
- We're gonna cook some spaghetti, yes.
- In wine?
- Yes.
- Hot dog.
- Yeah, right?
- [Safiya] Now Giada De
Laurentiis is another longtime
Food Network personality.
- Perfectly al dente.
- [Safiya] Who has hosted such
shows as "Everyday Italian",
"Giada at Home", "Giada in
Italy", "Giada Entertains",
"Giada in Paradise", et cetera, et cetera.
- Because I've got a lot of
Pinot Grigio in my fridge.
- [Safiya] If the show
names didn't tip you off,
Giada is from Italy and her
specialty is Italian cuisine.
- Bravo.
- Now we've actually been
to Giada's restaurant before
and we've enjoyed ourselves a lot,
so we were plenty happy to go back.
The Cromwell itself is
a pretty small hotel
and they've dedicated almost a third of it
to Giada's restaurant.
I like that Giada has her own wing.
- [Tyler] She has a big ass restaurant.
- Her own floor even.
Besides being huge,
it also features floor to ceiling windows
with pretty sweeping views of
the other side of the strip.
In this case, Caesars and The
Bellagio across the street.
I feel like pasta has
to be the call, right?
Right?
One thing to note, on the menu,
she also includes a guide
as to how to pronounce
some of the specific dishes.
Classic Giada.
- [Tyler] She's an emphasized pronouncer.
- [Safiya] This is kind of
a Food Network deep cut,
but one of the memes about Giada
is that she is pretty hardcore
with the pronunciation of Italian words.
- Spaghetti, linguine,
fettuccine, farfalle, orecchiette,
(indistinct).
- [Safiya] And while I'm sure
the names of Italian dishes
are often butchered.
- I like mascarpone.
(laughs)
- A little bit of that, yeah.
- Mascarpone!
- [Safiya] The way she
wrote out the pronunciation
for spah-geh-tee on the menu
looks just like spaghetti,
so I'm not sure how far
we're gonna get with that.
- [Tyler] How else do
people say spaghetti?
- Spag-hetti.
- No.
(laughs)
- Now to prepare ourselves
for a deluge of pasta,
we got a couple of very
welcomed cappuccinos, yum.
And a few appetizers like
the saucy Orzo meatballs.
It's a meatball.
- [Tyler] It's a lemony meatball.
- [Safiya] And the salty yet
still fresh grilled artichoke.
- That's a good sour flavor
actually, I actually like that.
- [Safiya] Sour, maybe
that's the word I forgot.
(laughs)
I forgot the word for sour.
But then we got into the good stuff.
We ordered the lemon
spaghetti with shrimp,
which is one of her signature pastas.
- [Tyler] It's a pretty beautiful plate.
- [Safiya] And it was
quite fresh in summery,
especially for a pasta dish.
- Signature-y?
- That's amazing.
And it also kind of started
off an oversized theme
that we began to notice in the restaurant,
because these shrimp were pretty big
as was the wheel of cheese
full of pasta that we got.
Do you see the cheese?
Look, this is cheese.
- Oh yeah.
- [Safiya] Which was then
seasoned by an enormous
pepper grinder.
That was the biggest
pepper grinder shaker thing
I've ever seen in my life.
- I think it's bigger than Giada.
- Literally.
(laughs)
It literally is.
All right, cheers.
The wheel of cheese itself
is hard to actually eat.
So it's not really like a bread bowl,
although I did just get a good hunk.
But the dish itself
basically ends up tasting
like a super fancy mac and cheese.
Creamy, a little bit salty
from the Pecorino Romano
and a nice kick from the cracked pepper.
The noodles closer to the wheel,
those are the money noodles.
- [Tyler] Cheese-mosis.
- Meow.
- [Tyler] Did you say meow or yeah?
- Both.
(laughs)
Meow.
The only real miss of the meal
was the pistachio souffle.
- [Tyler] What even is this?
- What did I order?
- I don't know.
- It sounded good and was
very visually pleasing.
It's like vaguely green, but not really.
But the nuts on top were
overwhelmingly salty
and the raspberry sauce
was very tart, wow.
That's blasting me right
back to Flavortown.
But that shouldn't eclipse
the rest of Giada's meal
and her spaghetti.
This place is good and
we'd happily go back.
- [Tyler] I'm worried about
our pillow test upstairs.
- [Safiya] You might stay there forever?
- Never move.
- [Safiya] We gotta
get to Bally's tonight.
Now next up on our list
we have Lisa Vanderpump's
Vanderpump A Paris
restaurant at The Paris.
- Okay the party's started!
- [Safiya] And Lisa
Vanderpump is most well known
for being a real housewife
of Beverly Hills.
- [Lisa] You can stab me in the back,
but whilst you're there, kiss my ass.
- [Safiya] As well as for
starring in "Vanderpump Rules"
on Bravo.
A show which follows her and
the staff at her restaurants
and bars in West Hollywood.
- Joe, I need my daily fix.
What's the special tonight?
- [Safiya] Now this is a bit
of a controversial addition
to our list, mostly because
Lisa herself is not a chef.
So in some ways she
shouldn't be on the list.
But we had a hard time taking her off
because unlike the Jonas Brothers,
she was a well-established restaurateur
before rising to TV fame.
- It's all going according to plan.
- [Safiya] And the show "Vanderpump Rules"
does specifically show her
running her restaurants,
even if it is more about the
love lives of her employees.
- I've just seen your boyfriend.
I do not wanna be dealing
with him, okay go.
- [Safiya] We are also big fans.
Lisa Vanderpump is actually
Tyler's celebrity crush,
so we really wanted to go.
There she is, that saucy minx.
On the strip specifically,
Lisa does also have a cocktail
lounge at Caesar's Palace,
which we did stop by.
But Vanderpump A Paris is
her only real restaurant.
And visually it's a show stopper.
It's arguably over decorated.
- [Tyler] Could use more Pomeranians.
- But it's also kind of awesomely ornate
with rod iron room dividers,
faux thunderstorms,
crazy street lamps, roses
everywhere, it's a lot.
The menu is like a big newspaper,
it's very cute, but
it's kinda hard to read.
And the cuisine here is
built as delectable dishes
with a little bit of of a French twist.
They may call me a sinner,
but I'm at peace with myself.
- [Tyler] It's sort of like
intro lines to real housewives.
- [Safiya] Which we
understood as mostly cocktails
and some fun small plates.
There are a couple of entrees,
but the entree section of the menu is tiny
and impossible to find.
So we followed that through line.
- [Tyler] Woo.
- [Safiya] And ordered a fancy cocktail
which was delivered in a glass
pyramid and a puff of smoke.
- [Tyler] Yeah, all that
smoke went right into my face.
(laughs)
- It smelled very campfire-y.
- It was amazing.
- [Safiya] And was quite strong.
- I'm drunk already.
- All right, no more, no more, that's it.
And then all of the food we
got was like small plates,
finger food kind of stuff.
The Ratatouille Frites
were the only thing I wouldn't recommend.
They didn't have a lot
of substance to them,
so they were kind of just
like little wisps of air.
It almost tastes like
calamari but no squid.
- [Tyler] It looks like calamari.
- Calamari but just the batter.
The Menage a Tomates salad was
sort of tomatoes three ways.
- [Tyler] Let 'er rip.
You getting a menage to the mouth?
- Yes, but the goat cheese is very greedy.
- Greedy?
- In bed?
(laughs)
- And it may not have been
the most groundbreaking dish.
Yeah, cut that in half
so then I can piggyback
off of your menage.
But after having been on the
strip for nearly two weeks,
subsisting mostly on Starbucks egg bites
and celebrity chef restaurant fair,
there hasn't been a lot of
fresh air nor fresh vegetables
on this trip.
Just some nice juicy tomatoes
with cracked pepper on 'em,
really hit the spot.
The truffle baguette was also very good.
It's amazing.
I know we have previously
complained about truffle
being an overwhelming flavor,
but there was just enough
bread, brie and honey in this
that we were able to taste something
other than just truffle.
You know what else is in there?
- What?
- Thyme.
Only gets better with thyme,
just like Lisa Vanderpump.
- Awesome.
- Tryna help you out there.
And then for dessert,
we got the rose eclairs
and there's gold leaf flakes on there.
The rose flavor was a bit overpowered
by a competing raspberry
flavor somewhere in there.
Goodbye, Kyle!
(laughs)
So it was more of a raspberry eclair,
but the creme en glaze inside
was really fluffy and light
and not too sweet and I love
me a not too sweet dessert.
- [Ken] Goodbye, Kyle.
- [Safiya] So overall, we
found Vanderpump A Paris
to be a whimsical and fun experience,
pretty much just as over
the top as Lisa herself
and as booze filled as an episode
of the "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills".
So pretty much exactly what I'd hoped for.
Now, our penultimate couple of restaurants
were at the MGM Grand,
which has a specific wing of
the hotel called The District,
which actually has a bunch of
celebrity owned restaurants
in a row, including the
Jonas Brothers' restaurant,
which I'm starting to
feel sad that we missed.
First on our list was
Masaharu Morimoto's eponymous
Japanese restaurant.
- [Tyler] "Iron Chef".
- [Safiya] Masaharu Morimoto,
apologies if I'm saying it wrong,
was famously one of the
Iron Chefs on the original
Japanese version of the
show in the nineties.
- [Announcer] Iron Chef
Japanese is Masaharu Morimoto.
- [Safiya] And then when the Food Network
decided to produce their
own version in the 2000s,
he signed on as one of the Iron Chefs,
lending the American version of the show
some serious legitimacy.
- [Host] A year ago they said this program
couldn't make it on American
TV, well look at us now.
- [Safiya] He actually
has a bunch of restaurants
around the world,
but I'm pretty sure that this
is his only one in Vegas.
(speaks Japanese)
(laughs)
- And the vibe in here is
very modern, dark and sleek.
There's an open sushi
bar kitchen in the first,
more narrow room and then in the back room
there is a special Teppanyaki
grill station as well.
It's a great menu, it's like
everything that we like,
basically.
- Yes.
- So to hit some of
Morimoto's specialties,
we ordered a lot of raw fish
and some sizzling hot stone dishes.
Okay we just ordered a
bunch of different stuff
and then Tyler goes,
feel free to keep the Diet Cokes coming.
- [Tyler] I dunno if they
charge for the refills.
- A lot of the sushi is
actually sold by the piece.
So I kind of just ordered
a bunch of pieces.
Wow, that's beautiful.
And our server really liked yellowtails,
so we ended up with a lot of yellowtail.
That went down easy, I love that.
And the sushi was overall very good.
There are a lot of sound
bites from our footage here
of us just liking it.
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg.
Why is that cute to me?
- It is adorable.
It looks like the rice is
carrying a giant egg mattress.
- [Safiya] We are by no
means sushi connoisseurs,
but I thought the rice was quite vinegar-y
and the fish was very soft and melty.
- It might be the best
cut roll I've ever had.
I love that.
- [Safiya] Are you shilling
for Morimoto right now?
- "Iron Chef" me up.
- [Safiya] We did also get
the raw yellowtail tacos.
- That's delicious and
it didn't fall apart.
- [Safiya] They had yuzu in them.
- There's some yuzu in there.
(laughs)
That's what it is.
- As well as lime and avocado
and they were very fresh
and citrusy and crunchy.
It's mostly guacamole and
spicy peppers, which is good,
inside of a wonton shell.
It's good.
And then we got a couple
of hot stone dishes
including these sizzling pork gyoza.
I'm nervous, I don't
want to burn my mouth.
- [Tyler] I'll go first.
- [Safiya] Which once they cooled down.
- A little hot.
(laughs)
- [Safiya] Were nice and
crispy on the outside
and well scallioned on the inside.
And then we also got the char siu bop,
which is pork belly, rice
and some other veggies,
cooked in a hot stone bowl.
It did sort of just taste like
a twist on a fried rice dish.
But I do love when rice gets
crispy at the bottom like this.
Thank you.
Then an item without a category,
we did get the Jasmine
panna cotta for dessert.
What's that?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- I don't know.
- Which came paired with
some blueberry ice cream
and lemon sorbet and kind of had the vibe
of a key lime pie filling
except instead of lime,
it was jasmine tea flavored.
It's like four desserts
in one, I'm obsessed.
Now we ran up quite the tab at Morimoto's,
but there were very few misses
and I would come back for
pretty much everything,
including the many Diet
Cokes they sent our way.
- [Tyler] They kept 'em coming.
- [Safiya] Now next upon our
list was Emeril Lagasse's,
New Orleans Fish House,
just down the hall.
- Bingo!
- Right?
- [Safiya] Though, thankfully
we went on a separate day,
not just right after Morimoto's.
Emeril is a true OG Food Network star.
- Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, hey!
And you take some peanut and you go bam!
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
- Having hosted many shows on the network,
all the way back to the early nineties.
In fact, Tyler's even
said that some of his
earliest memories are of
his mom watching Emeril.
- [Audience] Bam, bam, bam, bam!
- Bam, there you have
it, right now, all right?
- [Safiya] Which is pretty cute.
- [Tyler] That was like
the background television
of my very, very toddler youth.
- [Safiya] And Emeril
specializes in Creole, Cajun
and his self-developed
new New Orleans cuisine
and also has previously
contributed recipes
to be used on the
International Space Station,
which is pretty cool.
- Come on, this isn't
rocket scientists now here.
- Beyond the Fish House,
Emeril also has a Delmonico's
Steakhouse at The Venetian,
but we wanted to go for a restaurant
that really showcased
his signature cuisine.
The atmosphere at the Fish
House is actually very inviting.
Built around a circular bar
in the middle of the dining
room, it's pretty open
with warm toned woods and a large two-part
bronzy fish statue.
And we ended up ordering
just a few things.
First off, the clam chowder.
All right, chowder head,
go for it.
- Chowder head.
Me.
- [Safiya] And Tyler said Emeril's chowder
was nice and creamy and peppery
and the clams were the
right amount of chewy.
- That's so delicious, holy crap.
- [Safiya] Is Emeril the
king of chowder heads?
- No, I don't, that might
be very controversial
to say to New Englanders.
(laughs)
- We also got the barbecue shrimp,
that's super good.
And this sauce that comes with it
was very difficult for me to dissect.
What witchcraft is this?
It was a little spicy, a
little herby, a little tangy,
a tad sweet, maybe.
I have to figure out what's in the sauce
because I can't place it
at all, but it's amazing.
It turns out that this
is Emeril's secret sauce,
his essence, if you will.
- Now a lot of people have
asked me, what's the essence?
- [Safiya] Is it balsamic?
Help me out here.
And I think the things I was tasting
were the cayenne pepper, garlic
powder, oregano, and thyme.
- That's the essence.
- I would recommend this dish
just based on the sauce alone.
The jambalaya was also very seasoned,
possibly with another iteration
of Emeril's secret essence
as it had a pretty good kick to it.
That spiced rice is nice.
To be honest, at this point in our trip,
we were definitely experiencing
a little bit of celebrity chef burnout
or maybe just general casino burnout,
so we perhaps were not on
top of our tasting game.
- Well it's that kind of day, Rach!
What can you say?
- [Safiya] But we liked what we ordered
and if you are a seafood
lover or Tyler's mom,
you would probably also like it here.
That said, I really wish we had
gotten the banana cream pie.
Apparently it's really, really good.
- Kick it up a notch with
a little caramel like that.
Add a little chocolate like that
and finish it just like that.
(audience cheers)
- So I might need to come
back for that specifically.
And then for our last official
celebrity chef restaurant
on the strip, we have
Robert Irvine's Public House
at the Tropicana.
Welcome to the final hotel.
Though we do have a couple of other
celebrity chef restaurants we visited
that I figured I'd throw in at the end,
so stay tuned for those as well.
Now Robert Irvine is a buff ex-Royal Navy
British celebrity chef who has hosted
many a Food Network show.
(hammer bangs)
- Let's get to work.
- [Safiya] He has a few claims to fame,
like serving on Queen Elizabeth's
royal yacht, Britannia,
preparing food at the White
House and allegedly helping make
Charles and Diana's royal wedding cake,
some of which have been disputed.
- [Robert] Smokey, sizzly ribby ribbies.
- [Safiya] But those
are his claims to fame.
And Tyler and I are interested
by how truly buff he is.
Oh my God, not his throbbing forearm.
And I think that's fair
because it's a major part of his brand.
(screams)
He currently owns slash
operates two restaurants,
Robert Irvine's Public
House at the Tropicana,
and Fresh Kitchen by Robert Irvine,
located inside of the
Pentagon in Washington DC.
- Now we're cooking!
- So I guess his vibe is
like buff military chef.
Vein's popping, he flexes
and the booties pop.
- Robert Irvine.
- Volcano!
- Now the Public House
is a warm and inviting,
casual dining spot next
to the casino floor
of the Tropicana.
And the cuisine is supposed to be pub grub
geared towards the pats, AKA Americans.
I want a pizza, can I have a pizza?
- [Tyler] Pizzeria pizza.
- It's late night, it's time for a pizza.
So we got a couple of
casual pat focused dishes
as well as a couple of
Robert's personal favorites,
starting with his
eponymous drink order,
(bell chimes)
which is a shot of tequila
and a Stella Artois.
Wow.
That's a tall shot.
And our server confirmed
that he has literally seen
Robert Irvine drink this.
Last night in Vegas.
- That's tequila.
- [Safiya] This will
make you just as ripped
as Robert Irvine.
We also got the pastrami sandwich,
which Robert is pictured all
over the Tropicana holding up
next to a large knife.
- [Tyler] All over the casino.
- And this sandwich was
a little intimidating.
The pastrami meat was
salty and a little spicy.
The Swiss was sharp,
the rye and the sauerkraut
were sour and a little bitter.
It kinda puts some chest hair on you,
you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- No wonder this is
Robert's sandwich of choice.
What's happening to you?
Suddenly your hair, it's graying,
your biceps, they're growing,
your accent, it's changing.
- Hey there matey.
(laughs)
- We also ordered the waygu beef sliders,
which had these crispy onions on the side
that were kind of addictive.
If you hear any crunching
behind the camera,
I'm really sorry, I've
been eating crunchy onions
the whole time.
We also got the Rosso red
pizza, which was fine overall.
If I were drunk off of
a double shot tequila
and a single Stella Artois.
- You mean like me?
- [Safiya] This pizza would hit the spot.
Nothing to write home about,
but certainly not bad.
- It's pretty good but I have
had a double shot tequila.
(laughs)
- Now Robert's spot is
certainly more casual
than some of the other
restaurants on the list,
but I will say the price point
was, for the Vegas strip,
pretty reasonable.
In fact, as I noted in our hotel's video,
our entire order here, including
the Robert Irvine drink,
was cheaper than three chicken
sandwiches at Johnny Rockets.
So I am actually pro
Robert Irvine right now.
In fact, if you ever find
yourself at the Luxor
and considering eating at the
Johnny Rockets there, don't.
Cross the street and
go to Robert Irvine's.
Just do it.
Just do it.
He may be vaguely threatening
with his pastrami sandwich,
but he's a pretty reasonable man.
Don't you dare give another
dollar to Johnny Rockets.
Okay, so there were a couple
more celeb chef restaurants
that we visited sort of incidentally,
just because we thought they seemed cool.
We didn't document them
quite as thoroughly,
but I did wanna throw them in.
We're at Strip Steak,
we're on the Vegas strip.
Tyler is doing a strip
tease, he's eating a steak.
- Incredible.
- [Safiya] We went to Michael
Mina's Strip Steak restaurant
at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
- San Francisco's
Superman of Surf and Turf,
the legendary Michael Mina.
(chefs cheer)
- [Safiya] Michael Mina didn't
quite meet our requirements
because he's never starred in his own show
or other long form content that I know of,
but he's a very accomplished
chef and restaurateur.
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.
- [Safiya] Known for
modern American cuisine,
seafood and Mediterranean fair.
We got a smattering of different dishes.
- [Tyler] They didn't give you chopsticks,
so you might have to just fork it.
- Spear it?
- Yeah.
- With my steak knife.
Including the Ahi tuna
rolls, the filet mignon
and the spicy Thai lettuce cups.
That's very good, oh it's spicy.
As well as a magnificent bowl
of jalapeno creamed corn,
which kind of tasted
like molten cornbread.
Touche, Michael Mina, touche.
We also went to Roy Choi's
Best Friend restaurant
at the Park MGM, which
has a really cool vibe.
It's heavily themed and decorated
as a Korean convenience
store in the front.
And then in the back,
the main dining area is a large room
that's kind of themed like a block party.
Roy Choi's main claim to fame
is that he was the creator
of the popular Mexican Korean
fusion taco truck Kogi.
- If you don't look like Dexter
by the time you finish making
kimchi, you didn't do right.
- [Safiya] And he's considered
to be one of the founders
of the gourmet food truck movement.
We honestly just went to this restaurant
because it seemed good.
We didn't think that Roy Choi
technically fit our requirements,
but it turns out that he does appear
in "The Chef Show" with John Favreau.
- Look at that.
- [Safiya] And he's also
hosted a series called
"Broken Bread" on Tastemade.
If we had known that Roy Choi
should have been on our real list,
I definitely would've gotten
these short rib tacos.
- I told you I'm not gonna
show you the Kogi taco,
but I'm actually showing
you the Kogi taco,
(beep).
- [Safiya] But as it is,
we ended up getting some
of the veggie side dishes,
the yuzu barbecue shrimp,
there's that yuzu again.
- [Tyler] That thing is smoking.
- [Safiya] The pretty
pricey barbecue ribeye.
Hot?
- Forgot about the bone,
but yes, it's very good.
- [Safiya] And the pork belly bowl.
They also gave us some
complimentary Hawaiian sweet rolls,
which were awesome.
- They're definitely enhancing this, okay?
- Is this Hawaiian bread enhanced?
And their drinks all came served
in huge ceramic solo cups,
which was cool.
- That's a girthy cup.
- It's as big as Tyler's head.
- It is.
- [Safiya] Now onto the people we missed.
Yes, we may have made a couple of mistakes
in trimming down our list
of people, I apologize,
but I wanted to include them here
just at least as an acknowledgement.
Since we went to Vegas this past summer,
Martha Stewart actually opened
up her first ever restaurant
at the Paris called the Bedford,
which Snoop Dogg seems to love,
but we didn't get to go
because it was still under
construction at the time.
We also missed Wolfgang Puck,
I think because he's so
famous and ubiquitous,
I almost forgot he was a real
person who still does content.
I almost think of him like Campbell Soup,
but he does have five
restaurants on the strip
and a Wolfgang Puck Express
in the Vegas airport.
Michael Mina does have another restaurant
that is a joint venture slash
collab with Ayesha Curry
called International
Smoke at the MGM Grand.
And she does have her
own Food Network show,
but we just didn't actually
know about this restaurant
until day 12 of our trip.
So unfortunately it was a
bit too late to get there.
We also missed going to Nobu
for Chef Nobu Matsuhiso,
and we also missed Chica
by Chef Lorena Garcia
at The Venetian,
who both have shows that
aired internationally
that we just straight up didn't
find until after filming.
Also, if Lisa Vanderpump counts,
I think the Wahlberg Brothers
and their Wahlburger's
restaurant probably counts too.
So those are the ones that
we're gonna have to hit
when we go back to Vegas,
I guess for part two of this video.
But as for the ones we
did actually eat at,
in terms of an outro here,
we figured the best thing
to do would be to list
our top fives of our favorites
for different categories.
These are not ranked in
any particular order.
They're just sort of the
best ones of each category
in our opinion.
First up, for best overall
experience, our favorites were
David Chang's Momofuku, we are
definitely going back there,
Gordon Ramsey's, Hell's Kitchen,
we had high expectations
and he did deliver pretty well,
Giada De Laurentiis' Giada,
it's a favorite of ours.
Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and
Bar, for the vibes and nachos
and Jose Andres' Bazaar Meats,
very pricey but truly a
one of a kind experience.
For best dishes, our picks
were the sticky toffee pudding
at Hell's Kitchen, the
Yellowtail taco at Morimoto's,
the Brentwood Corn at Momofuku,
the Big Dipper sandwich at Guy Fieri's
and the Gazpacho at Tom Colicchio's,
because of the crunchy watermelon.
And then for best ambiance slash decor,
our favorites were Lisa Vanderpump's,
Vanderpump A Paris, again,
Giada De Laurentiis' Giada,
Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen,
Roy Choi's Best Friend,
even though we didn't really
document it and Bazaar Meats,
because of the smoking
meats and smoking cocktails.
Now one final thought
that I have been holding my
tongue about this entire time,
if I were to give a
sweeping recommendation
to all of the celebrity chefs on our list,
it would be lighten up on the sprouts.
'Cause it's sprout central over here.
There seems to be a
widespread sprouts obsession.
Sprouts, everyone loves sprouts.
- Everyone's putting
sprouts on everything.
- [Safiya] And after eating
a lot of them on our trip,
I got the mound of sprouts at the top.
- [Tyler] Yeah.
- [Safiya] I would say I don't even think
they taste very good.
The one thing we really
gotta ask ourselves is,
did this pizza need sprouts?
- Absolutely not.
- Just 86 the sprouts,
like do we need this?
Okay, so that was a lot of
food and a lot of restaurants.
I know this wasn't a perfect experiment,
it was more like a lengthy
travel log of us eating a lot,
but I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Thanks to you guys for watching
if you've made it this far,
and let us know if you'd be

hitting the missing restaurants.
