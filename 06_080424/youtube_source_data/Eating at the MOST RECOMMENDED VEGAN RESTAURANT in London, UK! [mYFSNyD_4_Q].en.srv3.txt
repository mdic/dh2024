because I'm in garage Hill this morning
I'm going for a walk to Alexandra Palace
the clouds are looking somewhat decent
there happens to be some vegan I don't
know if it's a festival
conference some sort of vegan event
happening at Alexandra Palace and it
just happened to fall in the time that
I'm in London so I thought I would pay a
little visit mainly to eat it's funny
because yesterday I was like eating so
much food and the last couple days I
feel like I've just been overeating
because of the overeating my stomach's
been hurting like I can't digest my body
is like kind of breaking down but then
by the time I digest everything and I'm
hungry again I'm like okay where to next
what should I eat now so anyway I
decided to go for a little stroll
because I figured you know gotta get my
exercise in before shoving in food into
my face because I feel like I feel like
if I was moving just as much as I was
eating I wouldn't feel so like bloated
and gross and digested and just like not
the best but because I'm just like even
though I am walking a lot I feel like
the amount I'm eating and drinking is
just like Beyond what's normal so
anyways I'm heading to Alexandra Palace
anyways I'm walking through Crouch end
which
I think is nice
got my coffee
