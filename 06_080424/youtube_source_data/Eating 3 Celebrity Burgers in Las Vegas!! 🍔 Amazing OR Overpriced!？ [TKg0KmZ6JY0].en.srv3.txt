I'm in Las Vegas and today I am taking
you on a celebrity Burger tour this
burger is huge
hey everyone hope you're having an
amazing day it's Mark Williams I'm in
Las Vegas
and today the mission is to eat at three
different famous celebrity owned burger
restaurants
I don't know if I've ever seen a top bun
on a burger so beautiful you gotta keep
going until there's nothing left look at
that hangover and here's the thing of
course celebrities I mean they have an
advantage the name the fame but at the
same time they have a little bit of an
unfair disadvantage I'll explain
[Music]
all right
when there's somebody famous that owns a
restaurant you and I we immediately have
a higher expectation
and when it comes to Burgers which are
one of the most popular foods in the
United States with so many different
options I mean there's Burgers on every
single Corner every single Street what
could a celebrity be doing to take it to
the next level to make it so memorable
to exceed your expectations or maybe not
[Music]
we made it to place number one and this
is owned by probably the most famous TV
chef personality on Earth
[Music]
we made it to Planet Hollywood
I'm very excited
okay we got a booth oh oh I love this
this blue these blue sofa benches but
welcome to Gordon Ramsay burger and it's
actually a pretty huge restaurant very
spacious very trendy uh right in the
center of Planet Hollywood and it's a
big restaurant uh but we got here in the
morning at about 10 30 a.m pretty much
right as they open so that's why it's
not packed yet because there's not that
many people but happy to be here for
Burger number one and I mean I don't
really need to explain this I think we
all know Gordon Ramsay easily one of the
biggest one of the most well-known
celebrity chefs on the planet he's a
British chef he's known for his TV
personality for Hell's Kitchen for
Kitchen Nightmares uh but then I mean he
he can stand up to the restaurant scene
as well with over 17 Michelin stars to
his name and now a burger chain as well
and I know there's Gordon Ramsay burgers
in a number of different cities but this
one perhaps is the most famous right
here in Las Vegas
hi there welcome to Gordon Ramsay Burger
thank you very much I'll be taking care
of your table this morning
as far as our burgers are concerned all
of our burgers are handmade and grilled
to order all of our Burgers will be made
with 100 Chuck what would be the most
popular Burger as far as the burgers are
concerned our Hell's Kitchen is our
number one selling burger and all of our
french fries are haircut I prefer the
Truffle parmesan fries it'll be a garlic
infused truffle oil it's also in the
fries while with Parmesan cheese and our
house made ketchup oh nice so also make
ketchup in-house all of our ketchup will
be made in-house we do offer Curry and
chipotle as well fantastic
could we get the 24-hour Burger
absolutely and then the Hell's Kitchen
Burger medium rare for me for the Hell's
Kitchen Burger
oh medium Mr Gordon eats a medium rare
I'm going medium rare
medium I would the rarer the better for
me okay medium rare for me for the
Hell's Kitchen Burger and then I think
we might just try the just fries
and that will come with the house
ketchup as well the Chipotle as well oh
okay excellent all right great thank you
very much
kitchen is open and they definitely take
their burgers to the next level Gordon
Ramsay I mean they're cooking using only
hardwood and you could just see that
smoke going up and they really like the
engineering on the burger it looks
incredible but before the burgers have
come we decided to try some hot wings
and the Oreo milkshake look at the size
of this Oreo milkshake it is
monstrous oh yeah these smell delicious
oh yeah
oh yeah
um
[Music]
all the juiciness the oiliness the
crispy skin
um
not too spicy but great buffalo sauce
maybe dipping a little bit of that ranch
okay oh we're going to try that the
milkshake even the size of this straw is
insane you have to take it below the
table to reach the top of the straw
oh wow that is so thick
you have to use all your strength to
suck it up the straw it's so thick and
creamy excellent how's the milkshake
it's pretty good
enjoy it
wow all right have your just fries that
comes with a house made Curry ketchup
and chipotle ketchup tossing sea salt
along with fresh chopped herbs thank you
my pleasure
of a burger oh yes
it's our homemade Chuck brisket excuse
me with the brisket on top the bacon
arugula pickled shallots of our famous
house kitchen burger with asajo jalapeno
avocados a tomato and our jalapeno aioli
thank you very much awesome I don't even
want to talk I'm so hungry I have to
pick this up immediately
oh that is beautiful
oh what a burger
oh oh
oh wow
oh that is so tasty and one of the
things that you will immediately notice
is how perfect that top bun is I don't
know if I've ever seen a top bun on a
burger so beautiful so perfectly formed
and shaped with a coating of sesame
seeds and you sink your teeth into that
burger the entire bun is so soft and yet
it holds its shape and then you get to
the meat it's so juicy you taste the
smokiness the cheese the avocado in this
burger
oh mem the perfect texture of meat to
fluffy bun all in your mouth and then
again for this one I ordered the Hell's
Kitchen Burger including asadero cheese
roasted jalapenos avocado roasted
tomatoes and jalapeno aioli
[Music]
yeah and I love that contrast of the
salty beef the creaminess of the avocado
the aioli jalapeno aioli and the
tartness acidity of the tomatoes I'll
just try the the classic fries real fast
serve with their own ketchup there's a
Chipotle ketchup and a curry ketchup I
guess we'll we'll find out which one is
which
[Music]
mmm well that ketchup is amazing I think
that one's a Chipotle has a smoky
roasted chili flavor to it
nice acidity from the tomatoes fries are
good just kind of like classic now this
one is the 24 Hour Burger and this was
one of the burgers that I was most
looking forward to trying here oh and
there's bacon too that all this is just
fully fully loaded fully stacked look at
that arugula look at that oh that bacon
oh it just feels good in your fingers
the other juices
oh so it's a burger with a short rib on
top with the bacon
you've got the kind of like kick of the
arugula and then the Pickled shallots
with the vinaigrette giving it that acid
or two the only thing about this burger
is this one is a little more well done
I like that other one that was rare much
more rare but it's still extremely tasty
extremely good quality beef the bacon
adds a lot
hmm
Jordan Ramsey has really taken it to the
next level in terms of quality of
ingredients this is really I mean
this is the definition of a gourmet
burger and really elevating
the hamburger
to Gourmet levels without being too
crazy without going overboard this one
is good I think probably my favorite is
just that and also because it's medium
rare okay I'm moving back to the Hell's
Kitchen
and that Patty is like extra huge too
that's an awesome awesome Burger I'm
gonna do a little ketchup
oh yeah
one Burger down so Gordon Ramsay burger
that was a solidly good burger
definitely you can taste The Gourmet
qualities of it especially the the
quality of the ingredients and the
quality of the beef that being said you
absolutely have to order medium rare I
think for me that's what really made a
difference
[Music]
just a short walk down the strip we are
at the next place there it is
[Music]
ah okay welcome to Wahlburgers and they
have a whole indoor section but we got a
table here on the outside and actually
this is I thought it would be more kind
of fast food where you you go to the
front and you order but actually if this
small Burgers it's a service restaurant
so you sit down and we'll have a we'll
have a server take our order oh okay now
I get it because the our Burger that's
one of the most popular Burgers here the
our Burger is if they break it down of
what is the difference between the
typical burger and our burger from
Wahlburgers but I think this burger
restaurant it needs barely an
introduction Mark Wahlberg one of the
most famous actors on Earth but this is
a collaboration between his brothers and
if I'm not mistaken Mark Wahlberg is the
youngest of possibly nine siblings Mark
Wahlberg though he's not only just uh an
actor but he's a rapper he's an
entrepreneur he was in a famous boy band
and he loves to eat but but he comes
from such a big fan family and I know
some of his other brothers are actors
have been actors as well especially
Donnie who's also a partner of
Wahlburgers and then Paul who is
actually a chef and Paul as I was
reading in the story about Wahlburgers
Paul was he always cooked for his family
and he loved cooking until he took it to
the next level he became a chef and he's
the chef behind Wahlburgers and also I
know they had a reality TV show as well
so it's a chef driven burger restaurant
backed by Mark Wahlberg and the entire
Wahlberg family and I didn't realize
this but there's over 90 locations of
Wahlburgers but this is going to be my
first time
can't tell if it's actually this green
or if that's the cup that must be the
color of the cup bright green lemonade
oh yeah with all the burger eating you
need this that acidity to digest oh
that's really good really sour
oh great thank you here's your
impossible thank you very much
and then this is a complimentary on the
house sweet potato tots thank you very
much
appreciate it this is perfect thank you
very much okay the burgers have arrived
the famous tater tots have arrived and I
got two different Burgers to try but
this right here
this one is the main event say hello to
the wahlburger our Burger
and I got the double look at that cheese
melting down the burgers that's
impressive I mean that's straight up a
cheese waterfall that it just makes your
mouth drool immediately oh you can smell
the beefiness I got it medium rare oh
that's so much cheese it's oozing the
Ooze is absolutely perfect yeah I mean
right off the bat I would have to say
what a presentation this burger just is
mouth-watering it makes you want to sink
your jaw your teeth into it immediately
good
juiciness
well it's a lot of meat in there good
double patties let me just stick
that's just like a quality Next Level
Burger almost by the books what you
think of your mouth thinks of when you
think about a cheeseburger and I do love
how there's an entire card here which
explains to you how the our Burger is
different from other Burgers so you can
read all about it I mean you have it's a
custom Artisan potato bun baked fresh
it's all that oozing cheeses government
cheese which brings it back to the
Wahlberg's family what they grew up
eating
brings back memories the burger is a
fresh blend of certified Angus beef
brisket short ribbon chuck all ground I
got it medium rare perfect house made
pickles fresh onions fresh tomatoes
fresh lettuce Paul's signature sauce
which is oozing out made fresh daily and
again the potato bun on the bottom
oh yeah
oh what a burger
I like how you really taste the
freshness the quality of the beef
and the quality of the freshness of the
vegetables the pickles and the potato
bun is just so light and fluffy when you
press it down it just kind of collapses
cradling the burger and not too light
and not too um and not too not too
fluffy just really presses down into the
burger
[Music]
or onion
I would call this
kind of your absolute classic American
hamburger cheeseburger but with A Step
Above in quality of ingredients and
freshness
got it a good burger
extremely satisfying Wahlburgers is also
very well known for their tater tots and
they have all these fancy tater tots on
the menu like the cheese and bacon they
have the chicken tots but I kind of just
like the the simple I'm playing just the
regular tots
on the side
oh it was a good day your time I like to
keep it simple though
those are good
then we also got
oh that's barbecue sauce good some of
the sweet potato tots as well
[Music]
nice sweet potato flavor not as fresh
beers the potato tater tots
a little buttery definitely a good
option and then I got one more Burger
absolutely had to try this burger the
burger the our Burger
is Paul's Chef Paul wahlburger
Wahlberg's favorite burger this is Mark
Wahlberg's favorite burger
it's a nice again a very nice top bun
look at that shape potato bun the Patty
cheese and caramelized onions in the
center Mark Wahlberg's favorite
foreign
[Music]
if I didn't already mention it
it's an impossible Burger all
plant-based except I think it's real
cheese smoked cheddar but the the patty
just plant-based oh yeah that's really
good I mean impossible burgers are
delicious barely taste the difference
between the texture of grilled beef and
it has that same meaty texture meaty
consistency meaty flavor to it the smoke
cheddar is really nice you've got the
fresh lettuce tomato in there and again
that bun So Soft just takes on the
prince of your finger in the bun I might
try it with a little bit of that
barbecue sauce on it would be good
hmm
really good I mean impossible Burger is
fantastic but okay you cannot compare to
the arbor the our burgers
that's just a solid again just a classic
burger cheeseburger
like
from the books something that you
immediately dream of and think of when
you think about a cheeseburger oh it's
starting to get Saucy oh yeah it's
oozing
for my next bite I might go in for just
a little bit of a a squeeze of ketchup
there we go
oh yeah made it down to the final bite
might dip it in that barbecue sauce
very satisfying Burger thank you to the
wahlbergs the wall burgers
let's move on to the next place
[Music]
[Music]
we're moving on to Burger number three
and again this is owned by one of the
most famous celebrity chefs TV
personalities and this is probably going
to be the biggest the most crazy Burger
of the entire Burger tour today
[Music]
the restaurant is located at the link
and we're ready to eat the next Burger
okay
here we go
oh welcome to Guy Fieri's Vegas kitchen
again I mean guy theory he hardly needs
an introduction but he's one of the most
famous TV personalities restaurateurs
he's known I mean one of the shows I
always loved was Diners Drive-Ins and
Dives where he covered uh the like most
classic food Across America things that
are oozing with cheese burgers fries
milkshakes at Guy Fieri's Vegas kitchen
now this restaurant I mean it's a it's
like an All-American restaurant there's
all sorts of things on the menu but he
has a couple of signature Burgers which
are extremely famous which is what we
came here to try
so so the bacon Mac and cheeseburger
guys award-winning Burger it says it's
voted best burger in Las Vegas by seven
magazine winner of the New York City
food and wine festivals Burger match
whoa it's here yes thank you very much
that's huge trash can nachos as well sir
trash can nachos awesome so that's gonna
in a can
oh the melted nacho cheese
and it does come out a little bit messy
okay I'll make sure it doesn't fall over
for you okay oh nicely done
is there anything else I can grab for
you at the moment that's all thank you
very much
it is gigantic the famous bacon Mac and
cheeseburger from Guy Fieri it's served
with a knife on the side but this is
just too good to be true I think I have
to have to pick it up
oh it's a tower
oh look at the size of that Patty oh it
actually picks up that is actually
remarkable that you can pick it up
without it collapsing it's amazing how
the mac and cheese just is cradled
within it without it oozing out what a
feat of engineering oh man I think you
almost have to eat it and I don't think
you can fully extend your jaw to that
size I think you kind of gotta take a
bite of the burger then a bite of the
top it's massive but we'll try
thank you
mmm
[Music]
you immediately taste the cheesy
creaminess of the mac and cheese
followed by the crispiness of the smoked
bacon
we got a fatty crumbly burger patty
the butter garlic On the Bun which is
soft
you've got all those finely shaved
iceberg lettuce fried onion rings that
also give it another texture it is tasty
it is actually remarkable how it stays
in shape even when you pick a bite
[Music]
it's somehow manages to stay together
and it just totally fits with Guy
Fieri's personality
everything stacked between a bun oozing
with mac and cheese the only problem is
if you pick this burger up this is the
type of burger you do not want to set
down or you may risk it collapsing it's
almost one of those burgers that you
gotta once you pick up you can't stop
you're all in you're fully committed
you gotta keep going until there's
nothing left
oh
now I got to the pickles I think they're
necessary because they kind of contrast
all that richness all that saltiness all
the creaminess with that acidity of the
pickles the pickle stays really good try
with a little bit of that ketchup
[Music]
okay
I'm gonna rest up and uh Burger comes
with fries there's a couple of different
fries in here actually some of the
waffle cup fries and some of the the
regular cut fries at the bottom with
these waffle cut fries look great
[Music]
mmm
excellent waffle cup fries really crispy
a little bit of seasoning to them as
well we have to move over to the trash
can nachos one of the most popular items
on the menu it's a massive mountain of
nachos
melted cheese barbecue pork tomatoes
onions I think you can try to try to
pick it up with your fingers but
eventually I think there's no way around
using a fork this massive pile
I did love the way it was served as well
in a in a can and then when they bring
it to your table they take out the can
and it just sprawls it kind of splatters
onto the plate and he himself said it
might be a little messy
oh the Smoky barbecue pork is what I got
immediately on that bike the beans the
cheese oh jalapenos
no fracturing it up it's so rich it's so
creamy there's so much melted cheese and
melted sour cream all the way
um
I think something about Guy Fieri's
kitchen here in Las Vegas
is that the dishes are playful they're
fun and they really represent Guy Fieri
and his like eclectic personality his
monstrous foods that are not only about
the foods themselves but about their
experience about the fun
of eating giant uh crazy things
and everybody you get something a little
bit different
despite I got some of the pickled
pickled onions or pickles challenge
after all you could do I I mean it's so
rich it's so heavy it's so creamy that
you need that acidity to break it down
let's move into the bacon mac and cheese
that giant oversized Patty it just
overflows out of the burger
and to be honest this is kind of like
eating three meals all in one and now
that I look at it
I think the macaroni and cheese actually
acts to like
plaster it together I mean it melts but
then it starts to harden as you eat it
holding the entire structure together
that's an amazing a genius design and
architecture
[Music]
look at that hangover the burger
hangover
foreign
do not
there's absolutely no way to stay clean
when you eat this burger
[Applause]
I think as a celebrity restaurant you
really have to create an experience you
have to design the restaurant the meal
in a way that your customers will really
remember it and so I think that's what
stands out I mean the ingredients need
to be top-notch the freshness the
quality needs to stand out and it just
needs to be an experience that you'll
remember and I mean when it comes to Las
Vegas this is one of the places in the
world where you have so many options
food that's Entertainment and I'll have
all three places that we went to in the

big thank you to you for watching this
