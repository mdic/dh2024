<p t="200" d="1920">Okay, so you may be asking yourself,</p>
<p t="2120" d="2760">Why are Josh and Ollie in a Rolls Royce.</p>
<p t="4880" d="2360">It&#39;s because we&#39;re going 
to a very fancy restaurant.</p>
<p t="7240" d="2360">So fancy, they told us they were gonna pick us up.</p>
<p t="9600" d="1240">In a Rolls Royce.</p>
<p t="10840" d="1600">A gold Rolls Royce.</p>
<p t="12440" d="4560">Here we are, on our way to potentially 
the fanciest restaurant in Asia.</p>
<p t="17000" d="2160">I am suddenly starving.</p>
<p t="19160" d="560">Me too.</p>
<p t="19720" d="1360">Now that we&#39;re in the building.</p>
<p t="21080" d="1480">I know it&#39;s 37 floors up,</p>
<p t="22560" d="1760">but I feel like I can smell it.</p>
<p t="24320" d="1240">Yeah.</p>
<p t="25560" d="1040">39!</p>
<p t="26600" d="1040">This way please.</p>
<p t="27640" d="1360">Thank you so much.</p>
<p t="29000" d="720">Okay.</p>
<p t="29720" d="720">Oh look at that!</p>
<p t="30440" d="1240">That&#39;s all wine.</p>
<p t="31680" d="1200">That is a wall of wine.</p>
<p t="33720" d="840">Thank you very much.</p>
<p t="34560" d="1000">43!</p>
<p t="35560" d="3880">We&#39;re going literally to the 
top of this enormous building.</p>
<p t="39440" d="4920">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="44360" d="1200">Okay.</p>
<p t="45560" d="2280">We are in the flipping dome,</p>
<p t="47840" d="1720">- of the top of the building.
- Apparently it&#39;s the second biggest  </p>
<p t="49560" d="1640">chandelier in the world.</p>
<p t="51200" d="1240">That there?</p>
<p t="52440" d="1920">Oh my gosh, I didn&#39;t even see the chandelier.</p>
<p t="54360" d="960">Look at that!</p>
<p t="55320" d="760">What?</p>
<p t="56080" d="3840">I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m wearing rich 
person camouflage right now.</p>
<p t="60560" d="1720">I&#39;m literally invisible.</p>
<p t="62280" d="1040">You&#39;re an idiot.</p>
<p t="63320" d="1360">Guys, this is insane.</p>
<p t="64680" d="3320">What is life?</p>
<p t="68000" d="1800">I&#39;m just nervously laughing.</p>
<p t="69800" d="1440">I have no words.</p>
<p t="71240" d="2560">Do they know who we are?</p>
<p t="73800" d="760">Good evening,</p>
<p t="74560" d="2660">Would you like some champagne before dinner?</p>
<p t="77220" d="924">- Sure.
- I wouldn&#39;t say no.</p>
<p t="78144" d="1143">If you insist.</p>
<p t="80680" d="1880">Are you going to try the champagne, Ollie?</p>
<p t="82560" d="720">No, no.</p>
<p t="83280" d="880">It&#39;s going to be good.</p>
<p t="84160" d="2240">I&#39;ll taste it.</p>
<p t="86400" d="760">Is it good?</p>
<p t="87160" d="1320">Wow, yeah.</p>
<p t="88480" d="1680">Yeah, that&#39;s very good.</p>
<p t="90160" d="960">That&#39;s very good.</p>
<p t="91120" d="840">To us.</p>
<p t="91960" d="880">To...</p>
<p t="92840" d="896">To...</p>
<p t="98480" d="1280">This is so surreal.</p>
<p t="99760" d="3720">So here&#39;s our bread trolley.</p>
<p t="103480" d="1300">I would like all of them.</p>
<p t="104780" d="3700">- I kinda wanna try one of everything.
- I love bread.</p>
<p t="108480" d="2000">Here we have our butter selection.</p>
<p t="110480" d="720">One is salted,</p>
<p t="111200" d="1560">and the other is unsalted.</p>
<p t="112760" d="2640">I love a bit of salty butter.</p>
<p t="115400" d="2040">Oh wow!</p>
<p t="117440" d="2400">Goodness me!</p>
<p t="119840" d="2800">We haven&#39;t even started on 
the food yet and already...</p>
<p t="122640" d="3520">I didn&#39;t breathe while he was doing that!</p>
<p t="126160" d="1240">Wow!</p>
<p t="127400" d="1080">Look at that!</p>
<p t="128480" d="1280">Goodness me!</p>
<p t="129760" d="1360">Mini croissant?</p>
<p t="131120" d="2435">Oh it&#39;s so light!</p>
<p t="140302" d="1098">It&#39;s perfect.</p>
<p t="141400" d="2180">It&#39;s so light and fluffy.</p>
<p t="143580" d="1340">Mmm.</p>
<p t="144920" d="1640">I feel like I would tell Lizzie.</p>
<p t="146560" d="3200">I had this dream I was on a 
really romantic date with Josh.</p>
<p t="149760" d="1920">Okay.
Okay.</p>
<p t="151680" d="2360">I hope that&#39;s not a 
conversation that happens often.</p>
<p t="154040" d="1760">I was on a really romantic date.</p>
<p t="155800" d="1240">She&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s nice.&quot;</p>
<p t="157040" d="3080">With Josh.</p>
<p t="160120" d="600">Good evening. x2</p>
<p t="160720" d="880">Hello.</p>
<p t="161600" d="699">I&#39;m Julien.</p>
<p t="162299" d="2101">- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Chef Julien.</p>
<p t="164400" d="2800">For your first, to get your appetite going,</p>
<p t="167200" d="1320">Oh.</p>
<p t="168520" d="960">Oh.</p>
<p t="169480" d="1720">Whoa.</p>
<p t="171200" d="3880">This one is uni with lardo and coffee.</p>
<p t="175080" d="840">For the non-uni,</p>
<p t="175920" d="1960">I prepared for you two shrimp balls.</p>
<p t="177880" d="960">- Wonderful.
- Amazing.</p>
<p t="178840" d="560">My pleasure.</p>
<p t="179400" d="1101">Thank you so much.</p>
<p t="180501" d="819">Enjoy your dinner.</p>
<p t="181320" d="2000">Chef just came out.</p>
<p t="183666" d="1774">He introduced the dish in person!</p>
<p t="185440" d="1420">What&#39;s uni?</p>
<p t="186860" d="1580">Uni is sea urchin.</p>
<p t="188440" d="2720">Uni is nomally a really intense flavour.</p>
<p t="191160" d="2720">He&#39;s given this to us basically right off the bat.</p>
<p t="193880" d="1960">And then gold flakes.</p>
<p t="195840" d="600">Alright.</p>
<p t="196440" d="2400">French chef playing to type.</p>
<p t="198840" d="2048">Yeah, intense flavours, they love it.</p>
<p t="215320" d="2600">Whoa!</p>
<p t="217920" d="3080">Really intense like sea flavour,</p>
<p t="221000" d="2080">but so creamy.</p>
<p t="223080" d="1240">That biscuit on the bottom,</p>
<p t="224320" d="1468">maybe that was the coffee biscuit.</p>
<p t="225788" d="1372">Biscuit was doing some heavy lifting there.</p>
<p t="227160" d="3160">Definitely the best fish cake I&#39;ve ever had.</p>
<p t="230320" d="2435">Doesn&#39;t really feel right 
to call that a fish cake.</p>
<p t="232755" d="2565">- It was basically an uni ball,
- It was on a biscuit base.</p>
<p t="235320" d="1240">instead of a meatball.</p>
<p t="236560" d="3120">Now, shrimp ball.</p>
<p t="248120" d="1080">Wow.</p>
<p t="249200" d="680">Okay.</p>
<p t="249880" d="1040">That&#39;s so good.</p>
<p t="250920" d="2880">It&#39;s a shrimp ball in spicy mayo.</p>
<p t="253800" d="560">But...</p>
<p t="254360" d="680">It&#39;s perfect.</p>
<p t="255040" d="960">It&#39;s perfect.</p>
<p t="256000" d="3680">It tastes how you imagine 
it, but five times better.</p>
<p t="259680" d="1560">Oh, dome, that&#39;s good.</p>
<p t="262080" d="4120">Okay, you were saving that one.</p>
<p t="266200" d="3400">Oh my gosh, I need to wash that down.</p>
<p t="270440" d="960">Here comes Julien.</p>
<p t="271400" d="3280">Oh, oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p t="274680" d="2840">For your second dish is a signature dish,</p>
<p t="277520" d="2280">a king crab on the bottom of your caviar,</p>
<p t="279800" d="1280">with lobster jelly.</p>
<p t="281080" d="1920">And the point is cauliflower cream.</p>
<p t="283000" d="1960">This one is one dish Mr. Robuchon created,</p>
<p t="284960" d="1360">more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p t="286320" d="1560">- 40 years ago?
- Wow!</p>
<p t="287880" d="1000">Thank you so much.</p>
<p t="288880" d="1400">This is beautiful.</p>
<p t="290280" d="1760">You&#39;re an artist.</p>
<p t="292040" d="718">We try, we try.</p>
<p t="292758" d="2442">- Thank you so much.
- Bon appetit.</p>
<p t="295200" d="1000">It&#39;s perfect.</p>
<p t="296200" d="1400">How can you eat that?</p>
<p t="297600" d="2280">That&#39;s the most beautiful 
thing I&#39;ve ever been served.</p>
<p t="299880" d="840">You could frame that.</p>
<p t="300720" d="1400">- Yeah.
- Put it up on the wall.</p>
<p t="302120" d="3233">Probably in the last couple of days 
because it would start to go mouldy.</p>
<p t="305353" d="887">Oh, it jiggles!</p>
<p t="306240" d="1960">It jiggles!</p>
<p t="308200" d="2120">The posher a restaurant is,</p>
<p t="310320" d="2400">the more jelly there is.</p>
<p t="312720" d="1720">Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go.</p>
<p t="314440" d="2920">I don&#39;t know if I can.</p>
<p t="317360" d="2018">- Watch me.
- I just want to frame it.</p>
<p t="323800" d="2072">Wow, that was extremely undignified.</p>
<p t="325872" d="2088">I think you just touched it with your hand.</p>
<p t="327960" d="1000">There&#39;s a fork as well,</p>
<p t="328960" d="1553">so you don&#39;t have to do that.</p>
<p t="338000" d="840">Wow.</p>
<p t="338840" d="1160">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="340000" d="1520">It just keeps going.</p>
<p t="341520" d="1160">So much flavour.</p>
<p t="342680" d="3400">That is so fishy!</p>
<p t="346080" d="2280">In the best possible way.</p>
<p t="348360" d="2120">It just tastes like fishy cream.</p>
<p t="350480" d="2280">Fishy cream.</p>
<p t="352760" d="1080">Which doesn&#39;t sound good.</p>
<p t="353840" d="1560">Lobster flavoured cream.</p>
<p t="355400" d="780">Lobster cream.</p>
<p t="356180" d="1900">- Sounds a bit weird.
- Also weird.</p>
<p t="358080" d="1400">Oh, Julien.</p>
<p t="359480" d="2680">What?
This one is langoustine ravioli,</p>
<p t="362160" d="2040">Mr. Robuchon created this recipe,</p>
<p t="364200" d="2120">because he started to travel in Asia.</p>
<p t="366320" d="720">When he came back,</p>
<p t="367040" d="2400">he had the idea to make the ravioli,</p>
<p t="369440" d="1080">look like a dumpling.</p>
<p t="370520" d="2040">What is a little bit different is,</p>
<p t="372560" d="1320">we put foie gras sauce.</p>
<p t="373880" d="1400">Beautiful.</p>
<p t="375280" d="1000">Whoa!</p>
<p t="376280" d="2608">Langoustine and black truffle inside.</p>
<p t="387680" d="1800">Oh wow.</p>
<p t="389480" d="1520">It&#39;s gone. It&#39;s gone.</p>
<p t="391000" d="2800">The foie gras sauce you think is going 
to be overpowering is not at all.</p>
<p t="393800" d="2400">It subtly compliments the flavours.</p>
<p t="396200" d="2080">Dome-it. That is so good.</p>
<p t="398280" d="1160">Shut up.</p>
<p t="399440" d="1640">That&#39;s like that&#39;s an emotional dish.</p>
<p t="401680" d="2800">It packs a punch like Jean-Claude Van Dome.</p>
<p t="404480" d="3360">Stop, stop.</p>
<p t="407840" d="2120">I&#39;ve had too much wine.</p>
<p t="409960" d="1720">Truffle really compliments.</p>
<p t="411680" d="1680">Who are you calling?</p>
<p t="413360" d="1560">You&#39;re calling Mr. Z.</p>
<p t="414920" d="880">Z!</p>
<p t="415800" d="1040">He answered!</p>
<p t="416840" d="720">Hi guys.</p>
<p t="417560" d="1000">How you doing?</p>
<p t="418560" d="2180">Why are you in a tux?</p>
<p t="420740" d="1940">Firstly, we&#39;re missing you here.</p>
<p t="422680" d="4000">That is the second biggest 
chandelier in the world.</p>
<p t="426680" d="1680">At the top of the Grand Lisboa,</p>
<p t="428360" d="3480">like the most iconic famous hotel in Macau.</p>
<p t="431840" d="2080">We&#39;re in a three Michelin star restaurant,</p>
<p t="433920" d="2680">that&#39;s had its three stars for 15 years.</p>
<p t="436600" d="2560">This is a Linguist... Linguistine?</p>
<p t="439160" d="640">Langoustine.</p>
<p t="439800" d="1920">Langoustine Ravioli.</p>
<p t="441720" d="4467">- It&#39;s the best pasta I&#39;ve ever had.
- Okay, calm down.</p>
<p t="446187" d="3293">- And it was made by a French chef in Macau.
- Stop, stop.</p>
<p t="449480" d="1160">How?</p>
<p t="450640" d="880">That&#39;s not possible.</p>
<p t="451520" d="1560">Does it taste 3 stars?</p>
<p t="453080" d="1960">Oh, this experience...</p>
<p t="455040" d="640">300.</p>
<p t="455680" d="1560">It&#39;s a whole constellation.</p>
<p t="457240" d="520">Wow. x5</p>
<p t="458480" d="840">So good to see you, man.</p>
<p t="459320" d="1280">- I missed you.
- Enjoy your dinner.</p>
<p t="460600" d="1080">We&#39;ll see you soon.</p>
<p t="461680" d="680">Ciao!</p>
<p t="462360" d="680">Enj...</p>
<p t="463040" d="1800">Oh, I hung up on Z.</p>
<p t="464840" d="1200">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="466040" d="1640">With the local vegetable,</p>
<p t="467680" d="1360">we have some beautiful green peas,</p>
<p t="469040" d="1280">you have some bok choy,</p>
<p t="470320" d="1520">and after we&#39;re making a bisque,</p>
<p t="471840" d="2600">but we&#39;re making it the same as a fish soup.</p>
<p t="474440" d="660">Fantastic.</p>
<p t="475100" d="1660">And what&#39;s the bubbles?</p>
<p t="476760" d="960">It&#39;s a fennel cream.</p>
<p t="477720" d="1600">- Thank you.
- Wow.</p>
<p t="479320" d="1560">Every dish here has felt like,</p>
<p t="480880" d="1720">it could be hung in the Louvre.</p>
<p t="482600" d="1080">Sometimes you go to a restaurant and you think,</p>
<p t="483680" d="1840">&quot;Oh, a bit of practice, I could cook that.&quot;</p>
<p t="485520" d="1520">Yeah, this is yeah.</p>
<p t="487040" d="1590">That&#39;s a really good point.</p>
<p t="488630" d="1370">I look at this and I go,</p>
<p t="490720" d="1994">&quot;How do you make foam?&quot;</p>
<p t="492714" d="2960">A lot of practice I would struggle to cook that.</p>
<p t="495674" d="1604">Is it like you&#39;re in a bubble bath,</p>
<p t="497278" d="2042">and you just put more in and go like that?
Well this is,</p>
<p t="499320" d="2160">this is a dome of lobster right there.</p>
<p t="501480" d="3560">It is staring me in the face.</p>
<p t="505040" d="3640">Dome it!</p>
<p t="508680" d="560">Dome it.</p>
<p t="509240" d="1710">Tres bien.</p>
<p t="510950" d="1250">Tres bien.
Maybe before the foam pops,</p>
<p t="512200" d="1720">we need to get stuck in with the bubbles?</p>
<p t="513920" d="1200">I want to have a bit of this.</p>
<p t="515120" d="3200">What is that?</p>
<p t="518320" d="2960">I have no idea what that is.</p>
<p t="521280" d="1400">Oh, it&#39;s so meaty.</p>
<p t="522680" d="2040">Oh, that is a lobster claw.</p>
<p t="524720" d="535">Let&#39;s do it.</p>
<p t="533634" d="1806">Heck yeah.</p>
<p t="535440" d="1120">Beautifully meaty.</p>
<p t="536560" d="3400">I think this might be the third 
time we&#39;ve had lobster this week.</p>
<p t="539960" d="2080">It&#39;s also the third time we&#39;ve had caviar.</p>
<p t="542040" d="1400">Shut up.</p>
<p t="543440" d="840">Are you serious?</p>
<p t="544280" d="2600">Yeah, you know, I was nervous when we arrived,</p>
<p t="546880" d="1880">but I think I&#39;m used to this now.</p>
<p t="548760" d="1760">Okay, you need to chill out.</p>
<p t="550520" d="1632">You need to take a chill pill.</p>
<p t="552152" d="2688">Are you ready for your second main course?</p>
<p t="554840" d="840">Oh wow.</p>
<p t="555680" d="1080">So still have room right?</p>
<p t="556760" d="1280">- Yeah, of course.
- Of course.</p>
<p t="558040" d="640">Definitely.</p>
<p t="558680" d="1320">If it&#39;s for food here,</p>
<p t="560000" d="1200">I will just keep eating forever.</p>
<p t="561200" d="1760">I&#39;ll keep eating until I die.</p>
<p t="562960" d="680">Oh gosh.</p>
<p t="563640" d="520">Oh wow.</p>
<p t="564160" d="1192">The box is smoking!</p>
<p t="565352" d="1608">- Yes.
- Oh, it&#39;s smoking a lot.</p>
<p t="566960" d="1840">Do you guys have fire alarms here?</p>
<p t="568800" d="640">Yes.</p>
<p t="569440" d="1680">Yeah, but don&#39;t worry.</p>
<p t="571120" d="1600">It&#39;s only for the black smoke.</p>
<p t="572720" d="1240">Oh my gosh!</p>
<p t="573960" d="720">Poor old Roman.</p>
<p t="574680" d="1280">Is it really heavy?</p>
<p t="575960" d="1880">You&#39;re hunched forward quite a lot.</p>
<p t="577840" d="1080">He goes to the gym every week.</p>
<p t="578920" d="500">Oh yeah?</p>
<p t="581080" d="1840">One of our signature dishes,</p>
<p t="582920" d="1440">it&#39;s a Beef Rossini,</p>
<p t="584360" d="1320">with beef and foie gras.</p>
<p t="585680" d="2760">But for this version we 
decide to cook them together.</p>
<p t="588440" d="4200">Half beef, half foie gras.</p>
<p t="592640" d="2600">This one is the famous mashed potato.</p>
<p t="595240" d="400">Oh!</p>
<p t="595640" d="2920">Mr. Robuchon became very famous in France,</p>
<p t="598560" d="1920">and in the world for this mashed potato.</p>
<p t="600480" d="1280">- Really?
- Yes.</p>
<p t="602400" d="1360">The time has come.</p>
<p t="603760" d="2698">Oh wow, look at that.</p>
<p t="606458" d="2253">Cheers mate.</p>
<p t="622440" d="2880">So much flavour.</p>
<p t="625320" d="1800">It&#39;s like a neutron star of flavour.</p>
<p t="627120" d="1920">Okay.</p>
<p t="630880" d="2700">You just Oppenheimered your taste buds.</p>
<p t="633580" d="2220">I&#39;ve got to try this mash.</p>
<p t="635800" d="3480">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="639280" d="3960">Mmm.</p>
<p t="643240" d="2560">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="645800" d="3320">That is the best mashed potato I&#39;ve ever had.</p>
<p t="649120" d="2920">Never have I cared less that 
I&#39;m allergic to potatoes.</p>
<p t="652040" d="960">You should stop eating that.</p>
<p t="653000" d="3160">- You should stop eating that.
- This is incredible.</p>
<p t="656160" d="2880">Somebody needs to try this.</p>
<p t="661920" d="720">Wow...</p>
<p t="662640" d="480">Yeah.</p>
<p t="663120" d="860">I think I should try that one,</p>
<p t="663980" d="2140">- just to make sure, they&#39;re the same.
- No, no, no, you get some mash.</p>
<p t="666120" d="1920">Have some mash, have some mash.</p>
<p t="668040" d="2400">Have some mash.</p>
<p t="670440" d="1680">That mash.</p>
<p t="672120" d="760">That&#39;s a British person,</p>
<p t="672880" d="2240">- who loves mashed potato.
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="675120" d="2040">I think this trip has just like,</p>
<p t="677160" d="3080">ruined any other meal I might ever have.</p>
<p t="680240" d="1240">Yeah.</p>
<p t="681480" d="2920">This mash is incredible.</p>
<p t="684400" d="1560">You&#39;re gonna hate me for saying this.</p>
<p t="685960" d="1120">Oh, what are you gonna say?</p>
<p t="687080" d="2880">It is better, but it is reminiscent,</p>
<p t="689960" d="5720">of the mash you get in IKEA.</p>
<p t="696200" d="1080">Right?</p>
<p t="697280" d="1360">You&#39;ve had... right?</p>
<p t="698640" d="1320">No!</p>
<p t="699960" d="2560">Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi play football.</p>
<p t="702520" d="920">I also play football.</p>
<p t="704160" d="560">Exactly.</p>
<p t="704720" d="2320">Now in the moment I could score a wonderful goal.</p>
<p t="707040" d="3240">Yeah, Luke could score a Messi-like goal.</p>
<p t="710280" d="1840">Like, it&#39;s not beyond him.</p>
<p t="712120" d="1222">Thank you,</p>
<p t="713342" d="1378">I appreciate that.
But much like IKEA,</p>
<p t="714720" d="2080">it would be a lot cheaper to sign you,</p>
<p t="716800" d="1360">- for your team.
- Yeah.</p>
<p t="718160" d="1160">And the difference is,</p>
<p t="719320" d="2040">Luke&#39;s gonna score out once in his lifetime,</p>
<p t="721360" d="1560">whereas Messi will do it once a week.</p>
<p t="722920" d="2120">Messi!</p>
<p t="725040" d="920">Macau.</p>
<p t="725960" d="1200">Amazing place.</p>
<p t="727160" d="3440">Turns out David Beckham genuinely 
knows what he&#39;s talking about.</p>
<p t="730600" d="2160">So the first day was Jade Dragon.</p>
<p t="732760" d="1320">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="734080" d="2920">-Three Michelin stars.
- It&#39;s a strange material to make a dragon out of,</p>
<p t="737000" d="2136">because it&#39;s very heavy.</p>
<p t="739136" d="1464">- Three Michelin star,
- Dragons have got to fly.</p>
<p t="740600" d="1560">Chinese food.</p>
<p t="742160" d="3840">That was literally just a 
little taste of what&#39;s to come.</p>
<p t="746000" d="880">It really was.</p>
<p t="746880" d="3960">It is going to be hard to 
reintegrate back into normal life,</p>
<p t="750840" d="3640">because we have been utterly 
spoiled over the last week.</p>
<p t="754480" d="2400">If you haven&#39;t caught every 
episode, you should go back,</p>
<p t="756880" d="1160">start from the beginning.</p>
<p t="758040" d="2080">Every single meal we&#39;ve had here,</p>
<p t="760120" d="1640">I feel like has just been a revelation.</p>
<p t="761760" d="1280">The egg tarts.</p>
<p t="763040" d="1440">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="764480" d="4080">People often think of them like how 
you think of Vegas or like gambling.</p>
<p t="768560" d="1640">We haven&#39;t gambled at all since we&#39;ve been here.</p>
<p t="770200" d="4000">We gambled with our digestive system.</p>
<p t="774200" d="1640">There&#39;s so much more to be had.</p>
<p t="775840" d="3000">so much more to be experienced and tried,</p>
<p t="779520" d="1040">when you&#39;re here in Macau.</p>
<p t="780560" d="4312">And it is 100% worth the journey.</p>
<p t="784872" d="3128">So some cheese after the main course.</p>
<p t="788000" d="1280">Some cheese?</p>
<p t="789280" d="2914">- Wow.
- That&#39;s a lot of cheese.</p>
<p t="792194" d="4">Yes.</p>
<p t="792198" d="2082">- Paul!
- We can&#39;t have all of it.</p>
<p t="794280" d="1880">Well, hey, don&#39;t say can&#39;t.</p>
<p t="796160" d="480">Okay.</p>
<p t="796640" d="1280">We probably shouldn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="797920" d="1320">So we have the Mimolette,</p>
<p t="799240" d="1560">we have the Brillat-Savarin,</p>
<p t="800800" d="1120">Reblochon,</p>
<p t="801920" d="1800">the strong Epoisses.</p>
<p t="803720" d="1440">Oh, we had this in a video.</p>
<p t="805160" d="3320">This one&#39;s banned on French transport.</p>
<p t="808480" d="560">Oh!</p>
<p t="809040" d="3360">- I forgot how strong it is.
- Strong, strong.</p>
<p t="812400" d="1160">These are my favourite!</p>
<p t="813560" d="1920">Those are the Carr&#39;s!</p>
<p t="815480" d="2080">And we have some bread for your cheese.</p>
<p t="817560" d="1460">Did somebody tell you that,</p>
<p t="819020" d="2260">- these are his favourite snack in the world?
- Oh really?</p>
<p t="821280" d="1160">I have these plain.</p>
<p t="822440" d="2869">Surely, Adam, surely you told them.</p>
<p t="825309" d="531">No, no, no.
Wow.</p>
<p t="825840" d="3440">- I feel like we should start with the Brie.
- Definitely.</p>
<p t="829280" d="1580">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p t="830860" d="3020">- It&#39;s like cream cheese.
- It&#39;s literally like cream cheese.</p>
<p t="833880" d="837">Cheers, mate.</p>
<p t="839461" d="4139">- Mm.
- Oh wow.</p>
<p t="843600" d="920">Cream cheese?</p>
<p t="844520" d="1280">What the heck?</p>
<p t="845800" d="1280">That&#39;s brie!</p>
<p t="847840" d="1980">That is so easy going.</p>
<p t="849820" d="2300">- We should probably wrap up this video, man.
- We should.</p>
<p t="852120" d="2920">We&#39;ve been here for three and a half hours.</p>
<p t="855040" d="1760">How do you end a video like this?</p>
<p t="856800" d="3160">I suppose simply to say thank you to Julien,</p>
<p t="859960" d="1240">to Paul and Roman,</p>
<p t="861200" d="2960">and to everyone who cooked 
and served us this evening,</p>
<p t="864160" d="2040">and to everyone in Macau who&#39;s looked after us.</p>
<p t="866200" d="1360">It&#39;s been an amazing trip.</p>
<p t="867560" d="2240">I really, really want to come back one day.</p>
<p t="869800" d="1960">I actually don&#39;t want to go home.</p>
<p t="871760" d="1080">I&#39;m sad to leave.</p>
<p t="872840" d="1560">Gabie&#39;s probably going to watch this.</p>
<p t="874400" d="2320">Look, I want to bring Gabie here.</p>
<p t="876720" d="1560">I don&#39;t want to go back, you know what I mean?</p>
<p t="878280" d="720">Yeah, OK.</p>
<p t="879000" d="1460">Wow, Macau.</p>
<p t="880460" d="780">Mmm.</p>
<p t="881240" d="840">You&#39;re just eating...</p>
<p t="882080" d="1880">Sorry, I&#39;m spitting everywhere.</p>
<p t="883960" d="1440">You are just eating,</p>
<p t="885400" d="4120">a dry cracker at the end of this entire meal.</p>
<p t="889520" d="2720">You&#39;re eating a plain Carr&#39;s cracker.</p>
<p t="892240" d="3800">That is the most Ollie thing I 
have ever seen in my entire life.</p>
<p t="896040" d="2200">Well, on that note,</p>
<p t="898240" d="1108">We&#39;ll see you jolly soon.</p>
</body>
