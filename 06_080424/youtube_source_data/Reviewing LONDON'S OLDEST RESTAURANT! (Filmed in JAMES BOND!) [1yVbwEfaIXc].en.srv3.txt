restaurant in London established
1798 now this is quite a quintessential
English restaurant and Spectre one of
the James Bond films was filmed in here
and down Abby as well you they've had
loads of episodes here now believe it or
not since 1798 it's only been owned by
four families and the first owner was a
guy called Thomas ruv say the name rules
might have you and now he used to
actually sell just oyers from here to
local market Traders our prices to
change for the oysters hey as always
let's give it a
[Music]
go
[Music]
okay here we are in the restaurant I
have got to say I'm Blown
Away it is Ste in history everything the
artifacts around the
pictures oh my Lord it is stunning it is
truly stunning than waiting staff so
attentive I cannot explain um gave us a
nice little booth here
well just it it is honestly it's
breathtaking okay on to the menu now i'
got a lovely range of house cocktails
cocktails there I'll let you take a look
at them and then you got a range of
starter so one of the thing is establish
is sort of establish to sell oysters to
um the Traders and they've got oysters
on the menu they got soups they got duck
shrimps you name it it's all there so
you take a look at that and then they
come to the mains now on the mains I'm
going to go straight for the steak and
kidney Pine because that is what they're
really famous for but again they've got
steak kidney puddings got other pies
here venison because again game is part
a main part of their menu then you got
the vegetables and salads um I'm going
to take a look at that now they've got
an incredible range of puddings here so
I'm definitely going to go for a pudding
I'm going to tell you what that's going
to be in a minute all around H say I'm
I'm almost speechless it's it's just so
beautiful so many famous people have
been in there as well um over the years
royalty um famous politicians I won't
mention certain names because you won't
be happy with that load of actors and
actresses and I can see why okay back to
the menu again um the vegetables and
sides under the potatoes they got mashed
potatoes chips or dolphin W I'm going to
go for the dolphin W that's
£550 and I'm going to get some of their
purple SP broccoli with tapanade butter
um that's an additional £550 now I sit
you about the puddings oh my Lord they
look absolutely fantastic but I'm not
going to choose my pudding just yet but
an incredible range there you say I'm
sitting here and I'm just wondering how
much history has gone through this place
you know through the Victorian period
through the wars if you like you know I
I do know it was open um during the
second world war um obviously worked
under rations and what have you but
because wasn't rationed we were able to
open through that but how much history's
gone through here I've ordered by the
way um and the interesting thing is it's
a 30 minute wake because they obviously
do the stick kidney pie um to order
which I think is a nice touch I've Turn
the Page over what a wine selection my
Lord I've never seen so many wines ever
um I will give it a bit of a wide birth
because um pricewise
um very expensive the other thing is if
you actually want to come here
beforehand they've got a bar um so you
can go in sit down have a couple of
drinks and then call you down to the
table and obviously if you're waiting 30
minutes for your sleep kidney pie you
want have a a relax somewhere else so
all real classy
touches see you in about 30 minutes no
not 30 minutes we'll cut okay see you
[Music]
soon
[Music]
okay so here we are about 30 minutes
later first thing I want to tell you the
smells that are coming off that um steak
kidney pie outrageous now my dolin eyes
PLO
there really creamy
I've got the broccoli with the tapenade
butter there on
top and we going move that over there I
have the gravy there as
well now I've got to tell you that's
quite a big
pie a very substantial pie now Bowl's
nice and
hot now I did complain last time um when
I I was served up in a bowl however no
complaints this time um mainly because I
want to drizzle all that gravy all over
the pie in a
moment
so where to start but it's got to be the
pie hasn't it oh another thing I do have
my English mustard here as
well I'll be tucking into that shortly
okay let's cut in see what it looks like
okay oh here that
christas on that
pastry the steam coming out
there all their beef here is 28 day aged
um all Source from
um English Farms British Farm sorry
yeah only one slight problem guys I
found a mushroom in there do you know
what for the channel I'm going to
actually try the mushroom I'm going to
I'm going to tuck in and try it because
everyone goes mad at me for not trying
it but first and foremost I'm going to
try I want to try that
beef take a look at it oh
beautiful steam coming off their amazing
smells that's quite
sad you put it in Melts in the mouth
gone it's no I want have it bit
more that is truly incredible some
kidney there I have that with there I
just have the kidney on its own let's
try
that
got tell you that wasn't a kidney not
mistake there's the kidney
there again that
genuinely just melts in your mouth
actually said that was mushroom I think
that's a kidney as
well well let's try it you can hear the
crispness of that
pastry let's try and get it all
together
put it in
there I think that's excellent in there
is that
gravy makes the P pie so
moist got it so well together as a
combination taking kidney pie you can't
really go wrong can
you wow wow I got to go for one more I'm
sorry i' got to i' got to go for one
more
more now what I'm going to do I'm try
these
potatoes let move that over there
slightly close up in
there a look at them
sers cream this cheese
just
incredible smells from it let's try the
doin wild
potato really
rich perfectly seasoned as well that
does not need any season that's the
interesting point there's no salt and
pepper on the
tables that's cuz they know they've been
seasoned perfectly now let's try some of
the broccoli here
now again just want to take a look there
that's actually quite a nice portion of
broccoli isn't it there's a lot of
broccoli in there all of butter in there
as
well okay let's see what it tastes
[Music]
like I tell you what I do like I do like
that tapanade butter
it's tapanade butter is made with Sund
Dred tomatoes
obviously C amount of butter but you can
really taste the sunri tomatoes through
that nice little crunch to the
um the
broccoli and it's full of flavor that is
fresh
broccoli that's happen kind of zingy
feel to it so imagine that will go
perfectly um with the um with the pie
definitely the steak in that pie
M that is right now the thing I am
interested in is the gravy take a look
at the color of that
gravy so wasn't the color I was
expecting it's all about the the flavor
and The Taste I'm not going to go mad
everywhere CU I want to taste it first
just put that in there like
that I'm going try it
here with some of the
steak
now the interesting thing is that gravy
it's the same gravy that's actually in
the
pie so that's been quite clever because
obviously you don't want different
different flavors going on so yeah do
like that
gravy now I better try one of these
mushrooms I promised you i' try a
mushroom let's try and hide
it
now tried the mushroom on the
channel unfortunately the mushrooms are
full of
flavor so you can taste them so I'm
definitely going to ruin my meal no more
mushrooms no more requests for mushrooms
mushrooms right out so I'm leaving the
mushrooms cuz I actually want to sit
here and really enjoy
this what can I say Quantity wise
excellent portions no issue on the
portions and that pie itself is a major
meal in itself there's lots in there
full of flavor all together what can I
say I'm in heaven yep I'm not silly it
is pricey sometimes you have to pay for
that
quality I'm going to savor
it I'll see you
soon okay I've got to tell you I am
actually really full up that's taking
kidney Pine that was really
substantial I was there going through it
I was like BL there's an awful lot here
and obviously then had the potatoes and
the broccoli with it as well now usually
when you come into places like this you
know the portions are a lot smaller and
you're kind of like oh actually I'm I'm
still hungry and all rest it not here
that's for sure but I did say I was
going to get a dessert
and I am going to get a dessert so what
do they have got the PE Tartan tart
Tartan apple and rhubarb crumble their
sticky toffee pudding I'm not having
that cuz I only just had that last time
baked Alaska pistachio cake rules golden
syrup sponge they got an English cheese
board and a um ston cheese board as well
and actually if you want Welsh rabbit on
sadough toast you can have that as well
now me I'm going to go for that apple
and rhubarb crumble with custard now
interesting enough having a look at the
menu all the way through the menu they
actually pair up um all the meals with
uh wines as well so here it says to have
a particular wine um which is 10 so I'm
not going to bother with that I'm going
to have the as I said the apple and
rubal crumble with custard and that's
£99.95 I think I might need a little bit
of a hand from the cameraman on this one
I am looking forward to it yeah
[Music]
definitely okay so here we are my
crumble is here apple and rhubarb one
that's
hot brilliant Aromas off that and
there's my uh custard as
well I that's could be vanilla custard
just having a look at it there
presentation wise that looks silly
doesn't it nothing just looking there
you got almonds on top as
well now let's dive in and see what it
tastes
like take closeup there you'll see you
got the Apple there you got the rhubarb
the one
thing it does desperately need sorry the
crumble there very very sweet I do like
the crunch of the almonds in there all
together real nice however take a quick
glance in there again let me put
over that
is very
dry so
essentially there a rub bu in
there what to have your custard let's
pour that Custard in
there look at that easing
through try get on the
tablecloth now let's try that as a big
combination not that big Gary that's
silly there we
go
I can assure you that is not powder
custard that is without a
doubt I'm not just saying this the best
crumble I've ever had in my
life you got the crunch there coming
through with the
almonds you got this real sweetness of
the crumble in the rhubarb itself slight
bit of feeling to the rhubarb which then
complements the Apple
perfectly and the
custard the custard just makes it now I
did say I'm going to be sharing this
with the cameraman however what I'm
going to do I'm going to get the menu
and Order him one for himself CU there's
zero chance of me sharing this with
anybody I I love the
presentation you
nice forget the forget the food if you
happen to be passing rules just come in
and say I'll have one of them crumbles
[Music]
incredible okay what I'm going to do I'm
going to finish this savor it then I'm
going to get the bill and then I'm going
to go upstairs and they've got to kind
of a a garden bar upstairs so I'm going
to see if I can actually do the final
review up
there well what did you think what mark
would you give it see you guys
shortly I'm having
fun okay I T you it's got a upstairs bar
area and kind of a garden area as well
it's it's enclosed but is jaw droping I
mean take a look at the images here so
relaxing he is really relaxing wouldn't
expect this right here in the middle of
Central London want to start let steing
kidney pie that was really really
substantial that was a big
pie really like the steak in there that
melt in your mouth as did the kidneys as
well it did have some mushrooms I wasn't
expecting that but the juice of that
gravy going into that pastry that pastry
was cooked to Perfection now you got to
bear in mind you got to wait 30 minutes
so it's made to order and I like that
you then have the dolphin M potatoes had
lots of cheese in there the cream the
potato itself was cooked perfectly oh
wow very rich that was very rich in
flavor and then you had the uh broccoli
there as well now I've got to be really
honest I didn't need all that you know
there was enough broccoli there and
enough potato for for two so if you like
I didn't need that kind of quantity the
other thing was was great was the gravy
cuz the gravy had all the flavors from
the steak and the kidneys as well which
went on top of the pastry and that was
you know just perfect onto the crumble
crumble itself is so sweet love the
Apple rubab in there I'm not going to go
mad about it cuz it was easily the best
one I've ever had custard perfect so on
to the bill for my steak and kidney pie
it was
£23.95 for my potatoes a Dophin wild
it's 550 for the purple uh broccoli £550
and my apple crumble
£9.95 total of £44.90 there was a 12%
discretionary service charge no issue on
that £
561 total of
5051 5051 for one person however one
thing I'm going to have to say here if
you come in here they actually do have a
set menu and I also when I looked on the
menu there they had um lots of different
Mills for two uh at less than £50 so
again it depends on what you're going to
come in and how much you're going to pay
now me I can actually break my scores
down I'm going to give the restaurant
itself and it's history a perfect 10 out
of 10 for that crumble that's an easy 10
out of 10 come on even you score that
that was
perfect for my steak and kidney
pie I'm going to give that a nine out of
10 I'm not going to split hairs here I'm
just going to say this was a 9 and a
half out of
10 guys I understand the price it's not
cheap there's no I knew the price before
I came in here so there's no point in me
sort of complaining in the menu outside
you can see the prices for yourselves so
you got the choice am I going to try it
or I'm not going to try it for that
special occasion I'll definitely be back
without a shadow of a doubt I will come
back here and I'd save for it without a
doubt listen I'd love to hear your
comments have you been to ruls if you
have love to know what you think of the
place but from my end for that special
occasion definitely give it a guy
you like And subscribe to the channel
you know I always appreciate that until
next
time I'm actually moving I'm just going
to sit here and relax for a while
bye-bye it's
