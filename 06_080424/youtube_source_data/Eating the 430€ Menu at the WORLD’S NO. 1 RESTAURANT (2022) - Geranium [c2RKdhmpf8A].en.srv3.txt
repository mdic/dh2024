Welcome to a taste of luxury.
In this channel,
I take you to some of the world’s most 
exclusive 3 Michelin-star restaurants.
My name is Alexander.
I’m the co-owner of a ONE 
Michelin star restaurant,
and I’m on a mission - to find 
inspiration in gastronomy.
I love fine dining, good wine
and sharing what I know with other people
So join me for a taste of luxury.
Welcome to Alexander the Guest.
Today, we have a special treat for you.
We are going to the top of the list 
of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants
to check out the 2022 champion,
Geranium.
Geranium is located in Copenhagen,  
but not where you might expect a 
3-Michelin star restaurant to be.
It’s not on the high street,
it’s not in a trendy neighborhood,
nor a 5 star hotel.
It’s actually in ….
a football stadium!
The genius in the kitchen 
is head chef Rasmus Kofoed. 
He is one of the best-known chefs in 
the world for winning the Bocuse d’Or,
which is basically the World Cup of cooking.
Rasmus took home bronze in 2005,
silver in 2007 seven and Gold in 2011.
He is the only chef to have all three statues. 
His restaurant, Geranium, was the first 
in Denmark to get 3 Michelin stars,
back in 2016.
So the all-star chef, Rasmus Kofoed
has won pretty much everything there is.
Now, he is coaching other chefs.
He coached the Hungarian team in 2016
and the Danish team in 2019.
both got gold in the European Bocouse d’Or.
I have been lucky enough 
to try his cuisine a few times.
Once was at a four hands dinner in Budapest.
I’ve also been to Geranium twice before,
but since I was here last,
the menu and the restaurant have been revamped,
so I’m looking forward to it.
I have big expectations.
After all, this is the best 
restaurant in the world.
Finding Geranium is easy.
Go to Parken,
the big stadium,
and go to the 8th floor.
You step out of the lift and into the restaurant.
You might think a stadium is a strange 
place for a 3 Michelin star restaurant,  
but when you see the panoramic 
view, you totally get it.
The space is huge and bright.
It has a clean, minimalist design
and large windows overlooking 
the park and the city,
all the way to the sea.
The concept has changed only slightly from before.
The white tablecloths have been 
replaced by marble-topped wooden tables
and the walls have floral accents.
Very tasteful.
It’s simple but luxurious at the same time,
and the Danes manage to keep the direct,
friendly atmosphere they are known for.
The same goes for the service.
It’s elegant, yet easy-going.
The welcoming is typical scandanavian.
Nice and simple.
Nothing is stiff, forced or over the top.
The servers are dressed differently, 
which is rare for a 3 Michelin star, 
but they look sharp, so it works.
The servers are young and international.
Some have come all the way 
from Australia to work here,
but none of them are veterans with the 
years of experience we see so often
at the 3-Michelin star level.
There are close to 40 people in the kitchen,
and the finishing area is out in 
the open and part of the show.
The final touches are done at the table, 
adding another level of excitement.
Geranium loves to innovate.
Last year, they introduced a pescetarian menu.
That means there is no meat,
but we can expect fish and seafood.
The chef himself has been 
eating this way for a long time
and here in Denmark, it fits.
The restaurant offers a degustation menu
featuring 19 pescetarian and vegetarian dishes.
The welcome champagne arrives by trolley,
with 4 batches available for tasting.
Krug is my favorite.
They used to have it by the glass,
but not anymore.
Times are changing
and Krug is getting more and more rare.
But still,
Geranium has a great selection to choose from.
The first course arrives 
immediately after the champagne.
It’s a crunchy seaweed basket 
in line with Danish tradition.
It’s basically edible art.
I’m blown away by the artistry and the taste.
Throughout the meal are beautiful 
dishes on spotless plates,
with tweezer techniques in every single dish.
The plates are all natural,
the flavors sharp and refined,
and everything is delicious.
The chef’s skill really shows
and it’s clear that his game 
is a step above the rest.
His menu is served in 3 acts,
with 5 starters,
7 savory
and 7 sweet dishes.
Some compositions remind me of 
a Japanese flower arrangement.
The flowers, of course, are edible.
and the courgettes form a stunning bouquet.
The next course is lobster,
and before serving, wild flowers are 
smoked at the table to enhance the flavor.  
It’s paired with an excellent red wine. 
At this moment there are simply no 
words to describe the experience.
I am in my happy place.
It is a visual frenzy that is 
high-end down to the last detail.
And then, they blinked.
The next course was a truffle dish.
It was good, but didn’t fit with 
the excellence of this menu.
In terms of experience and 
taste, it was a step back.
But with the desserts, a nice recovery.
Once again we were back to 
sophistication of an all-star team.
Multiple temperatures, textures and 
exciting presentation were all here.
Let’s talk about the wine list.
For the degustation menu,
there were 4 wine pairings to choose from,
ranging from 270 to 2700 euros.
Maybe the most expensive wine pairing on earth.
We chose the two middle courses and enjoyed 
some outstanding wines by the glass.
Geranium also has a non-alcoholic selection too,
with some interesting and delicious choices.
They serve kambuchas, extractions, 
juices and fancy mocktails.
After dessert,
the kitchen was finished,
and there was just some drinks before
it was time to say goodbye 
to our afternoon at Geranium.
The kitchen was done pushing out courses,
and we could feel the sense or 
urgency getting more relaxed.
All they needed to do was hang on for the win.
But sadly, here is where the 
service started to fall apart.
They relaxed a little bit too much.
Empty wine glasses and dessert 
plates were left on the table.
The water had run out,
and it had been 20 minutes since coffee.
In 3-Michelin star dining, we rarely see this.
Could I let it go?
Absolutely.
It was the only mistake I’d seen in three visits,
and otherwise it was absolutely perfect.
Before we set off,
I was invited to see the kitchen and wine cellar.
Both were spotless.
And now, my final thoughts on Geranium.
The new design is just what I hoped for
simple, elegant and beautiful.
That view is breath-taking.
The service was strong,
but they lost the ball at the end for a bit.
Maybe the young staff just needs more experience,
or maybe they could use a veteran.
It’s always good to have someone 
with 15 years under their belt.
Minus the truffle dish, the food was exceptional.
One of the best menus on the planet.
In a world of 8 billion people
it’s an honor to eat food prepared by the best.
Rasmus Kofoed proved to be a 
true all-star of the kitchen.
It’s really something.
The nearly three-hour experience is like no other,
and some moments blew me away.
I wish the service had gone the distance,
but it reminded me that even the 
best teams can sometimes slip up.
That said,
Geranium is still top 5 in my life.
That’s how good this place is.
Delicious, unique food presented beautifully
in a gorgeous restaurant overlooking Copenhagen.
For that, I would come back in a heartbeat.
And that does it for this episode.
Thank you for joining me.
Come back soon,
and together, we’ll go to  
the next 3 Michelin-star restaurant
and enjoy another taste of luxury
with Alexander the Guest.
