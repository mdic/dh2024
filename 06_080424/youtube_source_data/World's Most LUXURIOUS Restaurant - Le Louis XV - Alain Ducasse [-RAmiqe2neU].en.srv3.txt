Today, we go to Monaco.
The playground of the rich and famous.
And home to our restaurant for today,
Le Louis XV.
It’s located inside the Hotel de Paris
in the entertainment district of Monte Carlo.
The hotel opened in 1864
and has been entertaining guests 
for more than a 150 years.
They have every service under the sun.
They will even pick you up at a nearby airport
with a helicopter for 1500 Euros.
The casino is also world-famous.
You might recognize it from films 
like Iron Man 2 and Golden Eye.
Le Louis takes fine dining to a new level.
It is named after King Louis the 15th of France
who was known for his love of food and luxury.
They spared no expense and 
the restaurant opened in 1987.
Everything is dripping in luxury.
The fresco on the ceiling, the 
chandeliers, the gold leaf.
Plus the view of the sea.
And downstairs, there are 4 
hundred thousand bottles of wine.
The cooking style is classic French 
cuisine thanks to Chef Alain Ducasse.
So who is Alain Ducasse?
He was born in 1956 in France.
He got his education in culinary arts,
and at age 24 was awarded his first Michelin star.
He was well on his way.
Then, in 1984, a disaster 
nearly cost him his life.
He was on a private jet with some members 
of his team, flying over the alps.
They hit a patch of bad weather and 
crashed into the face of the mountain.
Ducasse was the sole survivor.
He was badly injured, but he was alive.
From his hospital bed, he went back to work.
Creating recipes, writing menus, 
and managing his restaurant.
He was unstoppable.
In 1986, the Prince of Monaco 
offered young Alain Ducasse a job.
Head chef at his brand new restaurant
Le Louis the 15th
But the position came with a challenge.
Get 3 Michelin stars within 4 years.
It took him just 33 months.
Today, Ducasse is the 2nd most decorated 
chef of all time with 21 Michelin stars.
He seems to have done it all.
Including a special menu for 
the International Space Station.
Making him one chef who’s cooking 
truly is out of this world.
We step in the door and wow.
Take your breath away.
The space is absolutely huge.
Now I know why it’s called Le Louis.
It was designed for a king.
I have to say, I’ve been here before.
In 2019.
And was not for me.
It was a bit boring and old-fashioned.
We are greeted warmly and shown to our table.
The champagne trolley comes around 
and they have a great selection.
I go for a glass of Bereche and Sons.
We decide on the 6 course 
tasting menu for 380 euros.
The first thing to the table was 
flat bread with mushrooms baked in.
They were super crunchy with a nutty flavor.
I really liked it.
Our appetiser shows us the 
colors along the riviera.
The amuse bouche is lightly smoked sashimi
from 4 different fish caught fresh that day.
The service is dramatic.
Everyone and everything is treated as if 
they are the most important in the world.
Here you can experience what 
it’s like to be royalty.
The first course is shrimp with 
rockfish jelly covered in gold caviar.
They say “if you’re going to 
serve caviar, use a big spoon.”
The chefs at Le Louis were listening.
It’s a tremendous opening course.
Our next course is Zebra squash with sea anemone.
Anemone are also known as the flowers of the sea.
But they are most famous as 
protectors of the clownfish
who are immune to their poisonous tentacles.
The cooking process makes them safe for us to eat.
They have an intense seafood 
flavor, offset nicely by the squash.
The eating tools here are playful, 
interesting and luxurious.
Our next course is blue lobster over a woodfire
The sweet, smoky flavor is 
mouthwatering to think about.
One of my favorites of the day.
Suddenly we are invited to tour the kitchen.
It is massive and buzzing with excitement.
We get to meet Chef Emmanuelle Pilon.
He is super friendly and generous with his time.
He puts the final touches on our next course.
Cuttlefish sliced razor thin with 
porcini mushrooms and ink juice.
This dish has rich, complex flavors
and we eat right there in the kitchen.
It feels spontaneous, but I’m 
sure it’s all part of the plan.
We get back for our main course.
Veal with green cabbage, 
crushed citron and anchovy
The veal is free-range, ultra-tender 
and cooked to perfection.
They find a beautiful balance of 
sweet, salty, sour and bitter.
The pre-dessert is a green apple and mint granita.
It’s a frozen dessert from Italy 
and here it is absolutely perfect.
No meal would be complete 
without the cheese trolley.
Of course, these are some of the best 
and most expensive cheeses in the world.
It's always nice to make your own selection.
The next dish looks delicious 
but its not for eating.
It’s actually rose petal-infused 
water for cleaning our hands.
Royal treatment once again.
We tried two desserts.
One is a rum baba, with a choice of rum.
I love the dramatic presentation.
The other is pear in three ways.
Slices, in a soufflé and a sorbet.
Irresistible.
After the meal, we go out to the terrace,
to enjoy the sights and sounds of Monte Carlo at night.
The waiter was so kind to bring the petit fours out to us.
It was a perfect end to a delightful experience.
For the drinks, the wine menu is huge.
Remember, they have four hundred thousand bottles.
I let the sommelier do his job and 
select wines to go with each course.
With the sashimi,
a lovely chardonnay, a premier cru from 
the Saint-Aubin region in France 2017.
With the squash and sea anemone,
an another wonderful chardonnay, 
a Chassange Montracher 2019
With the lobster,
a nice pinot from 2016.
With the main coure,
A Carignon from the South of 
France. A good match with the veal.
The sommelier was highly skilled and the 
wine work really nicely for it's price.
At the end of the day, the 
total for 2 came to 1007 Euros.
And now my final thoughts 
on Le Louis the fifteenth.
The design is unreal.
It’s a palace of pure luxury.
The walls, the ceiling.
All the special utencils.
I love it.
The service was great.
They really know how to make you feel important.
I liked the perfect mirror service.
Elegant and professional but kind and generous.
I had a great meal.
Since my last visit, the kitchen has 
grown and exiting new directions.
They have kept the traditional 
French cuisine but added a twist.
Like the fermented vegetables and the sashimi.
Beside the chef, I would like 
to highlight another gentlemen,
the headwaiter.
He was like a conductor, 
organizing everything brilliantly.
It must be challenging to maintain 
perfection in this massive place.
For me, Le Louis the 15th redeemed itself today.
Here you can experience what it's like to be king.
