[Music]
it's great to be back
this time I'm going to reveal a hidden
Italy Italy as the locals noise
this is the ultimate secret place to be
for the locals I'm going off the Beaten
Track come with me to let you in on the
best kept secrets of my precious
Homeland from all Traditions being kept
alive just incredible incredible
spectacular scenery
and most importantly
the food Heritage that made me and
shapes my home country
this is what Italian people like to eat
I'll share my tips for making
mouth-watering authentic Italian food at
home
a lot of work for some inside
information so come with me Gino
d'acampo as I give you the Insider's
Guide to in Italy
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I've chosen seven regions that for me
have some of the best kept coloring and
cultural secrets that Italy has to offer
my journey of Discovery will take us
from the North in trentino Auto adije
and lombardia down through Umbria and
Tuscany and then up to liguria and
pimonte but first i'm starting right in
the center
tonight I'm deep in Hidden Italy on the
Adriatic Coast in the region of Abruzzo
this little known region sits in the
middle of Italy bordered by Lazio Marque
Umbria and the Adriatic Sea
[Music]
it's a world away from Modern Italy one
third of it is home to three national
parks make it one of the most rural of
the Italian states
it's so far off the Beaten Track it only
opened an airport at the turn of the
century fishing and farming are these
regions lifeblood so that's what I'll be
experiencing firsthand
as we Italians are proud of our pasta
I'm curious to find out first about a
special tie for this region created so
I'm starting my journey in the coastal
town of pescada
[Music]
and the Very place to find out about the
kiptara pasta is this Artisan shop
keeping alive it is 200 years old
tradition is Giovanni minikuchi who
opened this shop in 1965. he now runs it
with his son Claudio
amazing
incredible
the guitar shape is think about a
spaghetti but Square edges Giovanni has
continued to use this handmade method
for the past 50 years
see look at that that's like watching an
artist paint amazing
I can't believe that in 2016
they're still doing this kind of thing
by hand and watching this is just
incredible incredible the kitara is
named after the guitar-like instrument
they used to shape the pasta so this is
stainless steel stainless steel wire
that is only one wire and it goes up and
down up and down up and down
as Italy has over hundreds of ships of
pasta then why did the abruptions feel
the need to invent one more
he was saying that the farmers around
here they wanted to create a shape that
is associated to them so everybody we
know that the guitar comes from the
farmers in a Bruton that's how it
happened time for me to learn the art of
making these regions iconic pasta
question
is Claudio tells me the secret is to
push the pin and let it roll itself
so the first time you need to be gentle
just to stretch the uh the pasta sheets
and the second time you need to be
firmer so then you cut it through
bravojira
okay
the reason why it's called guitar
because then you need to do like that
and all the pasta falls down
Gino Hendrix Gino Hendrix
Claudius offered to cook the pasta to
prove that the shape really does make a
difference
Cheeky Monkey he said not too much pasta
once your belly is going to get big
unbelievable
three minutes later
[Music]
better than
wow you can really feel the square
pieces of pasta into your mouth and
you get the egg you got the same Olaf I
love the fact that it is simple you know
the Simplicity the way they serve with
the bit of tomato sauce and a bit of a
grated Parmesan cheese but the thing
that I feel the most in my mouth and I
don't want to be sentimental or romantic
or anything like that
I really feel the passion that these
people have for what they're doing and I
really wish that I could be part of this
family of this tradition somehow because
it's just incredible
fantastic
you know Wonderful release
and the locals certainly agree
so came to find more hidden gems have
heard about the bird family they are
preserving another traditional Bruton
way of life on the most historical
stretch of Coastline of the region
this is the traboki coast a UNESCO world
heritage site this Century old
Contraptions were used so fishermen
could avoid getting into the tumultuous
Adriatic Waters 25 year old Thomas bird
was more than happy to explain his
family's long history with these unique
platforms Thomas are here his great
grandfather builds the traboco in 1898.
then your grandfather in chameleon 1922
your father
1957 and then Easter Master here which
is run the uh traboco nowadays
wow that is that is four generations of
fishermen
Thomas
explained that he and his father dropped
the net every morning at 5am but what
makes it different is that they check
them every 20 minutes and this type of
fishing is called scaling the waters
here have been rich with anchovies
sardines sebas and seabream but
sometimes there are a lot of underwater
winds where it pushes the net upwards
instead of being down and they don't get
any fish whatsoever this ancient
technique can't compete with the modern
ones so the entrepreneurial family
Diversified their business they chose to
modernize the traboki turning them into
restaurants and capitalizing on this
stunning location guaranteeing its
future for generations to come see this
is one of the reason why I actually came
here because what I love about to mass
is the fact that a young boy
but still has the passion and the energy
to keep all these beautiful Heritage
this antique way of fishing alive and
that's the reason why I'm here now let's
see how unlucky I am with fishing
this wooden Pole or winch is attached to
a system of weights and pulleys which
lift the Nets this is easy look I can do
backwards if I want to or I don't tempt
you at all I love cooking with fish but
fishing is a different matter so it
should come as no surprise then
nothing
nothing not even one little tiny little
fish nothing
never mind my man never mind
[Music]
fish may not be on the menu tonight but
at least I got my handmade kitara pasta
to cook with
I'm in a mood to cook proper Italian
food and when I say properly Italian
food I don't mean spaghetti bolognese
and all that stuff that Italians don't
really eat I'm talking about number one
mustard ingredients that is kitara pasta
if you can get kitara linguine will work
just as well I'm going to cook this
pasta with extra virgin olive oil garlic
cherry tomatoes a little bit of chili
and rocket leaves simplicity at its best
and this is what Italian people like to
eat so that is my secret for you today
and my next tip is
I don't have any heat underneath the pan
my grandfather always said to me
whenever you cook with garlic and you
want the best flavor out to the garlic
you need to make sure that the pan is
cold you slice your garlic you put it
there then you put the extra virgin and
then you switch it on so slowly slowly
the heat to the extra virgin marries
into the garlic and you get the best
flavor trust me my grandfather's tips
have never let me down so thinly sliced
two garlic cloves pour in the extra
virgin olive oil
and then just two or three pinches of
dry chili flakes
[Music]
now the only thing we have to do put the
heat underneath while the pan heats up
you prepare your cherry tomatoes by
simply slicing in half
when the garlic begins to color add the
tomatoes and give it a good stir now you
want to cook the Tomato no longer than
three to four minutes so I got pot with
boil in hot water in there we're gonna
have to put the salt straight away
before we cook the pasta and then of
course
my guitar pasta
like all good Italian pasta it should be
cooked al dente which will take five to
six minutes one more ingredients I'm
going to use is white one this is a
local wine called pecorino really really
good for this recipe and I'm just going
to put a problem about half a glass of
wine in there no more than that
[Music]
the uncle is evaporating but the flavor
of the wine stays in there my last and
final ingredient in the sauce I got
rocket leaves look at that fresh rocket
leaves and I'm going to cook them like
you would cook spinach the peppery
rocket contrasts perfectly with the
sweetness of the tomatoes season and
remember my roll always add the pasta to
the sauce now if you look at the pasta
And the sauce together there the pasta
is nice and Al Dente the last 22nd
what's going to happen the pasta is
going to start to absorb the flavor of
the sauce so immediately as soon you're
going to twist it and put into your
mouth bang bang bang all those flavors
boom explode
job done so pick it up
straight
plates
and look at that all those beautiful
tomato the rocket leaves
people that say to me do you know what
is your favorite
Plato pasta this is Italian food at his
best
what I like about Abruzzo is how much
the locals they cared about the
tradition and the passion that they have
for their family for the region the
passion that they go for the food is
second to none I absolutely love it love
it love it so I can't wait to find out
what other Secrets this region has to
offer me
foreign
seeking out its Aiden James I'm
traveling the heart of Abruzzo as I'm
being told the scenery here is something
I've never seen before
it's gonna be great a 90 minute drive
takes me deep into the rural Heartland
of this ancient state to the Siren
tableino National Park and on the way
the landscape is a feast for my eyes
jatty now to the lunar escaped mountains
are Majestic castles Yoon out of the
rock this particular Castle Rocka
calacio was originally built as a
watchtower in the 10th century and is
the highest fort in all of Italy perched
nearly 1500 meters above sea level
[Music]
ending down I find myself in the rugged
heart of the region where I meet Mauro
defonza whose farmed this terrain for 15
years and the wild landscape has some
very unique challenges I I said you know
he is in Paradise I mean what can he go
wrong around here he's all nice and
peaceful and he just said well yes in
that same peaceful if you don't have a
bears and a wolf is trying to eat the
Sheep I wasn't expecting that he said
but don't fear because he's got the
proper dogs that if the Wolves of the
Bears are coming ah they're gonna attack
the uh the Bears and the wolves and
everything is going to be all right
these incredible dogs defend the ship
from Wild brown bears they are trained
to protect by bonding with their charges
right from when they are pups I did ask
what kind of dog is a dog that can
actually attack a bear and a wharf and
he said it's called marimano Abruzzi
it's called
so if you're at home have problem with
bears and wolves that's the dog that you
need to get
a typical flock can be as large as 200
as they roam freely 10 dogs keep them
safe
[Music]
so he's telling the ship with a little
whistle to turn left and go towards the
mountain
[Music]
really yeah you can see I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try watch this
they're like my children they don't
listen at all
okay I've tried the carrot
maybe it's time to reach for the steak
[Music]
this is harder than I thought I think I
need a break
foreign
I wasn't expecting this kind of romantic
setting under a tree and apparently he's
got something that he wants me to try
hey
he said there is a local specialty from
Abruzzo and he's challenging me he said
if you can cook this that's mean you're
a real Abruzzi which is a man who comes
from
Mauro tells me that he has rostuccini is
a typical Shepherd's snack made from
bite size chunks of matter I'm gonna
show him attacking being a Buddhism and
if I want to
[Music]
I'm not one to shy away this has
inspired me to make lamb skewers with a
green bean and goat's cheese salad now
I'm going to start right here with a
fillet of lamb I'm using fillet because
it's nice and tender I've cut the lamb
fill it probably about the size of an
ice cube in there straight away we're
going to add runny honey and very
important because it's going to give a
nice sweetness to the meats add three or
four teaspoon of honey
sprinkle a tablespoon of fennel seeds
a pinch of black pepper then chop up a
bunch of fresh mint leaves I want to use
them fresh because I want the best
flavors for my skewers add a squeeze of
lemon juice and finally a good splash of
extra virgin olive oil now at this point
I don't know if you realize I haven't
used any salt whatsoever I got a theory
with salt and meats if I'm going to put
salt in here now on the meat and then
put them on the barbecue I'm always
afraid that the salt is going to drain
all the moisture away from the meat and
it's going to make the meat very tough I
always season the meat with salt once
the meat is cooked now I could leave
this to rest for 12 hours 13 hours it
doesn't really matter remember the
longer you keep in marinating and the
more flavors you're gonna get the
important thing though if you keep to
marinated for 24 hours make sure that
you keep the meat in the fridge
with my mates I'm going to serve peppers
and my tip with peppers never use the
green one because the green one they're
very bitter I always use the yellow one
or the red one so you want to cut the
peppers more or less the same size of
the meat
I like to use metal skewers when I do my
skewers because they're very easy if you
want to use the wooden one fine but then
you have to soak them in water otherwise
the bird metal one I think the more
candle
Macho Man I always put two cubes of lamb
followed by a piece of pepper until the
skewer is full there is only one way to
know when a barbecue is ready and this
is where my grandfather told me you
shouldn't be able to keep your hand on
the barbecue I mean do not touch the
grill of the barbecue it just just above
the grill no longer than 3 seconds if
you can do that longer than three
seconds it means it's not hot enough one
two that's it it's ready
is ready there is a sexy sounds that I
want you to hear it's nothing better
than a skewer gonna hot barbecue listen
to this
[Music]
I thought he was sexy now I want to cook
my skewers for about 12 minutes and the
reason is because I want to do three
minutes on each side so I've got enough
time to do my green bean salad
for the size salad I've boiled the beans
for 3 minutes I'm adding in extra virgin
olive oil some fresh lemon juice then
half a handful of pine kernels
and the reason why I put the pine
kernels because I like the crunchiness
salted pepper goes in there
and my last
ingredients in the salad goat cheese use
a soft goat cheese so then when you toss
everything together it's going to kind
of become like cream
I'm going to serve it
right here on my chopping board
that looks good now is the time to
season
these skewers because it's right at the
end and straight onto the serving plate
final squeeze or lemon juice
that's it I'm happy and this is how I
made my version of a rostitchini
time for the taste test
honesto okay
relaxing that is impossible
um
he said the delicious but it's not going
to give me the honorary of being an
abruzzle man
take care I'm very proud to be a
Neapolitan and I'm very proud of my
skewers and I'm actually very proud to
be here and uh to make a new friend
Bonnie zombie you should try this
amazing
[Music]
thank you
[Applause]
