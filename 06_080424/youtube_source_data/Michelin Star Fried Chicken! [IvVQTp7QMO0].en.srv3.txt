This is it,
Michelin Starred,
Fried Chicken.
This is next level!
That is hella good.
Already we're 3 courses in,
This is some of the most creative food 
I've ever had.
Oh my gosh!
 What the heck.
The tall giraffe, the angry turkey, the elegant elephant and the humble chicken.
Which one are we at today?
The restaurant's called Humble Chicken.
This is one of the hottest spots in London right now.
They've literally just been given their Michelin Star.
Wow.
Look.
It's oddly appropriate that we're here because I am dressed as a chicken in its humblest form.
Okay, baby chick.
Yeah, baby chick.
Or the egg yolk, depends.
Depends where it is in the gestation.
Wow.
We are definitely the first people to film here after it's just been awarded its Michelin Star.
I'm not surprised they chose us right because we're two of the humblest guys you could know.
What do you mean they chose us?
Pretty sure we chose them.
I mean, I'm probably a little more humble than you.
Oh, okay.
I'm not sure that's how humility works.
No?
Let's see whether it lives up to the hype or they need to make and then eat a humble pie.
Okay.
Wow, thank you very much.
Look at that.
That is stunning.
It looks like something you'd see in a rock pool.
That is a mussel that's been stuffed in with stuff.
So it's like juicing.
A mussel on steroids.
Can I say that?
Look at that.
Very humble move in a chicken restaurant.
Starting with a mussel.
Starting with something other than chicken.
He doesn't want to be in the centre of attention.
He said give it a little slurp.
I think that's the first time I've ever been told that in a restaurant.
Very exciting.
Wow.
Oh my gosh.
The mussel is full of flavour.
It almost like explodes and bursts out when you bite into it.
What is it?
It's quite sour, limey.
Is there soy sauce in there?
Can you guess any of the ingredients?
Wow.
Mussel.
Yeah.
Citrus kosho ponzu.
Wait, wait.
You were never gonna guess.
Let me guess.
Citrus koshu ponzu.
You still got it wrong.
Even I just told you.
And apparently some avocado as well.
And some...
Is there avocado?
Is there just an hint of avocado?
Yeah.
I need to start doing steroids.
If that's what my muscles will taste like, I could be licking all day.
That is very strange.
Thank you very much.
Flavour bomb.
I thought the first mouthful was a flavour bomb.
I was listening to all of those words.
I got no idea what this is gonna taste like.
It could taste like ice cream.
Persimmon on the bottom, which I think I've only ever had in Korea.
And then some liver and then hazelnut.
And they've shaved up this foie gras on top.
Wow.
This feels like an art piece.
Oh wow. There's like bits in there.
It's a very creamy texture.
It's kind of like muesli.
It's quite creamy.
Like overnight oats.
Yeah.
Cheers.
Oh my gosh.
It's the best pate I've ever had.
Luke, you need to try that.
That is incredible.
I normally hate pate.
That is incredible.
The liver the foie gras.
It sounds like it's going to be overpowering,
But it's got these little sweet bits of persimmon in there,
And these crunchy hazelnut bits.
So you get all these different textures.
Oh my gosh.
The combination of textures and different flavours.
And sweetness and saltiness and like strong flavours.
It's like Nutella at the end.
With the texture of Nutella.
The hazelnut in there.
I think the hazelnuts have been like caramelised or something.
No, it's popped rice.
Popped rice.
Yeah. That is good.
That is hella good.
That's one of my favourite dishes I've had in London.
It's incredible.
Wow. Slow down.
Yeah. Okay. Sorry.
That's incredible.
As far as like, starters go, Michelin star places,
Often spam you with starters.
Just coarse after coarse.
- Bread.
- So much bread.
They might bring a bread trolley.
So here's our bread trolley.
You never know.
There's no room for a trolley.
We do love a bread trolley.
You'd have to lower it from the ceiling.
Having to climb out of the vent like mission impossible.
The tension is building.
Because the humble chicken hasn't come out of his hiding place yet.
No.
Oh, what's this?
Is it chicken?
It's not chicken.
Some smoke.
Oh, lovely.
Thank you very much.
No chicken.
No chicken.
They're playing with us.
He's toying with us.
He is.
Spotlight.
This is beef.
Look at that.
Again, presentation is on point.
Yeah, beef tartare.
With deep fried bone marrow.
Wow.
This is next level.
All right, let's do it.
Cheers, mate.
Look at that.
All in one.
You're just going all in one.
Wow.
Just keeps going.
It's like eating the best...
Keeps going.
Salad ever.
Wow.
Salad.
I can't describe it.
Best beef tartare I've ever had.
You've ever had?
Ever?
Yeah. When have you had a better beef tartare than that?
It's literally like the perfect beef tartare in this crispy little delicate tartlet with
a ball of deep fried bone marrow.
How do you even think of that?
It's so creative.
Already we're three courses in.
This is some of the most creative food I've ever had.
Oh my gosh.
That's a lot of it.
That's a lot of it.
This is it.
This is Michelin starred fried chicken.
The humble chicken has been waiting for its moment to shine.
It was patient.
Yeah he was.
And it was like, you know what?
I won't come out as a drumstick.
That's too showy.
I'll come out as a pair of balls.
Okay.
I mean I get what you mean.
But he said this is chicken from the, you said chicken oyster?
From the butt.
From the butt region.
The muscle next to the butt.
We've been talking about the butt.
The butt region.
Wow.
I mean it's literally wearing like a little caviar top hat.
Cheers mate.
Wow.
Can you see how juicy that is?
The batter is quite thick.
Oh the batter is like crispy and crunchy.
But the chicken inside is so juicy.
And then I don't know what that relish is on the top.
It's like a kind of really nice mayonnaise.
And then it's just amazing.
So juicy.
So crispy.
That batter, crunchy and the juiciness of the chicken on the inside.
Also caviar often plays like an unnecessary role.
You know? Just superfluous.
That caviar on there, the saltiness, creaminess it added.
With the mayonnaise.
It's not that humble this chicken I've got to say.
Oh no, it's super humble.
Everything in here is like...
Dalai Lama, very impressive man.
Very, very impressive.
One of the most impressive people on the planet.
Super, super humble.
Okay so you're saying just because they're impressive doesn't mean it's not.
Roger Federer.
Yeah.
Very humble guy.
Good point.
Very, very humble guy.
But then you've also got Michael Jordan, you know?
Less humble.
Yeah.
Conor McGregor, another example of someone who's got a way to go in the humbleness department.
All right guys, I'm sure you're thinking where is this amazing bar?

Oh my gosh, there's another course.
Okay, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.
Oh, look at that.
What?
There's a little fried egg in there with a runny egg yolk.
This is definitely the cutest thing we've ever had at a Michelin star restaurant.
Little piggy buns.
I mean it feels, it's so soft.
Feels almost criminal.
Wow, can you see the egg yolk running out?
Oh my, what the heck.
Hell yeah.
That is the best sausage and egg McMuffin I've ever had.
It is.
It's pork.
Is it pork?
With egg.
That's a Michelin star sausage and egg McMuffin.
No, it's not a muffin.
It is.
The bao.
That's a huge compliment.
That is a huge compliment.
Ollie's changing the name of the video.
It's now Michelin star sausage roll.
That's the best thing we've had so far.
Yeah.
Also, if you had this for breakfast, you could have like 10, 15 of them.
Yeah, you could, you could.
I'm literally just wiping the egg yolk off the plate because it's so good.
That was incredible.
Like what?
McDonald's are missing a trick.
If they could just do that.
They, you can't compare that to McDonald's Ollie.
It was beautiful.
So fluffy.
The fried chicken though.
You might as well be talking about McDonald's breakfast.
The fried chicken was so, okay.
Have you got that thing up your sleeve?
No, dear Lord, no.
Not this time. Not again.
He does look like Ronald bloody McDonald today.
Represent. Available for sponsorship.
So the Michelin man, he's taken a while to come, come around to fried chicken like the rest of us.
But man, that guy has taste.
He has taste.
He has not missed the mark here.
This place.
It is legit.
I mean, we've eaten in a lot of Michelin style restaurants right.
Over the last year.
Almost as much as you and Gabie.
Okay.
Way more than me and Gabie.
What are you talking about?
Nice of you to say.
Gabie's jealous at this point.
She's very jealous.
Good.
Okay.
Wow.
This looks straight out of an anime.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Look at that bread and butter, the presentation levels.
I mean that honestly just looks like bread from one of Juno's...
Toy kitchen sets.
Yeah.
Or like we're in Spirited Away.
Our parents just turned into pigs and we arrived and we're like, wow, that bread looks incredible.
I'm traumatized.
Let's eat.
I'm also ready to turn into a pig just so I can eat this stuff.
And then we served it with this little refreshing palette cleanser.
They're like scrolls aren't they?
I've never seen butter that's been stuffed with something.
Look at that.
Okay, come on.
I need to get some of this bread.
Wow.
It's perfect.
It's perfect.
It's perfect.
Cheeky little loaf.
It's so warm.
It's so warm and fluffy.
All right.
Smell it.
So buttery.
Brioche.
Oh my gosh.
Butter with chicken liver and truffle inside the butter.
Because why not?
Bread is often one of our favourite things we eat at Michelin star restaurants.
And this bread looks...
Not quite as good at presentation as the restaurant.
How have you made it look so terrible?
I felt like I laughed quite loudly.
Wow.
What?
I've never had truffle or liver in my butter before.
I want it more regularly.
Lurpak. Listen up.
That is a thing I want.
Can you imagine if they sold it in the supermarket with liver and truffle inside a slab of butter.
Should we give some to the guys?
Luke and Grace need to taste it.
Grace first.
That bread is so warm.
So soft.
Sorry.
Sorry.
That was quite loud.
You haven't even drunk any of it yet.
Feels like we're three beers in.
I just threw my napkin over it like it was a dead body.
Grace couldn't even laugh because she had a mouthful of bread.
Killing grace behind the camera.
Luke.
Come on.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
That bread, Luke.
That bread.
It is so good.
I think we should come back here tomorrow night to check it's the same.
Oh, I think we should.
Yeah, consistency check.
I think that makes sense.
That's good with you, Aidan, right?
That sounds fun.
Yeah, deal.
If you don't get the bread right, the Michelin man, he comes in, he walks straight out.
He probably bounces off the bar because he's made of rubber.
You missed the pickle as well.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, we need to...
I don't want to cleanse my palate from that taste.
I want to keep that taste in my mouth.
Look at this.
It's like a scroll.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, very pickled.
Very pickled.
Is it radish?
It's like a warhead.
It's quite sour.
It is quite sour.
What is celeriac?
Very refreshing.
Oh, is that what that is?
Tastes a bit celery-like.
I thought celeriac is that disease where you can't eat gluten.
Celiac.
Celiac.
Okay.
Palate cleanser.
Yeah.
It does feel cleansed.
Very.
In the same way that bleach cleans the surface.
No, stop.
You can't say that.
No, it is strong.
It's effective.
Very effective.
That's what you're saying.
Very effective.
There's nothing there, now.
There's nothing there.
That's true.
I am salivating.
Oh, I'm salivating.
There you go.
Okay.
Let's...
I feel like we're taking a conversation.
Yeah.
It's true, though.
It's true.
Wow.
Okay, gentlemen.
This is insane.
This restaurant literally does it all.
Fried chicken.
McMuffins.
McMuffins.
I'm just giving in now.
It's kind of overwhelming.
First off, I think the Spanish yellowtail.
Oh, wow.
Oh, that's cucumber.
What, the little balls?
It's cucumber.
Little cucumber balls.
Sea trout from Aberdeen.
It's so eclectic, right?
Yeah.
Literally, this course, we could be in a sushi specialist restaurant.
Some of the nicest sushi I've had in the UK.
Two courses back, we could have been in the world's greatest McDonald's.
It does feel like you're almost walking through a neighborhood in London, you know?
Yeah, well, I guess like London, it's that collection of foods from all over the world.
It's just superb.
Wow.
The burnt sesame oil.
I flipping love that.
All right, this is the Japanese tuna loin, I think he said.
The wasabi on that.
This is one of my favourite meals I've ever had in my life already.
We're not even done yet.
The addition of vegetables and jelly.
Mint jelly!
It's like catnip to the Michelin Man.
He loves it.
He sees a bit of jelly, he's like whack a star on it straight away.
This is top three London meals.
For sure.
In my life.
Wow.
Amazing.
Everything has just been unbelievable.
I don't know how you're able to do so many different things so well.
I'm genuinely like, I want to give you a round of applause.
Whatever you're doing, you're killing it.
This is amazing.
I really want to come back.
Like I'm gonna book this for Gabie ASAP.
It's a bit rude while I'm sitting here, literally in the middle of the meal being like,
I want to come back with someone else.
Well...
Imagine you said that to Gabie.
I can't wait to come back here with Ollie.
Oh, goodness me.
Wow.
That's an egg, that's an egg.
It's a Japanese Scotch egg.
There's a giant crispy egg on top and then underneath the egg...
Short rib.
Short rib.
Sukiyaki.
Broccoli.
Okay, yeah, 10% broccoli.
I love broccoli.
Really?
Yeah, I love broccoli.
That much?
It was probably my favourite vegetable.
My parents.
Of course it's not.
Sorry, I misspoke.
Yeah, I should think so.
All right, so are we going with the egg first?
I want a bite of the crispy egg.
Oh, come on.
Look at that.
Oh my gosh.
This food is absurd.
How does that feel?
That is insane.
It's so rich.
It's perfect.
What is this?
Is it teriyaki sauce?
Sukiyaki.
Sukiyaki.
What's that?
Terry's cousin.
Sue.
Crazy Sue.
Oh my gosh.
Look, Luke, you need to try this.
This is not fair.
It's not fair.
It's literally not fair.
Everything is unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
That steak has just melted.
It's unbelievable.
The steak is almost softer than the egg.
You're right.
The steak is softer than the egg.
How?
This is one of the best meals I've ever had in my entire life.
In such a humble setting.
There's a nandos.
I'm literally, I can see a nandos from here.
That's how humble this is.
Mate, that was...
Thank you so much.
Everything is out doing.
Every other dish is unbelievable.
Next one's the star of your show, so.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Wow.
That's a frozen Clementine.
Oh, wow.
Oh, that's cool.
It's like a Clementine bingsu.
It's like bingsu.
Wow.
Thank you very much.
Frozen Clementine shavings cheesecake.
All right.
Wow.
Oh, this is better.
It does get better.
Wow.
This is absurd.
This is actually absurd.
So...
Wow.
This has been Michelin star fried chicken, Michelin star muffins, Michelin star everything.
One of the best meals I've ever had in my life.
I mean, I think this is my new favourite place in London.
Yeah.
Absolutely it is.
Yeah.
All right.
I can't believe it.
It's absolutely incredible.
I don't even know whether I've been that articulate in describing quite how amazing it is,
but just imagine all of the things you're trying, the beef rib, the pork sandwich, the fried egg.
Everything was perfect.
Everything was perfect.
It was perfect.
And not only that, it tasted like things you hadn't even tasted before.
This has been incredible.
Thank you so much.
First meal of the year on camera.
See you jolly soon.
Humble beginnings.
