if you love to eat sandwiches you will
love Porto
Portugal oh yes look at that ratio
that's how we want a sandwich to be yes
pure smoked
ham he's like a
chainsaw that's as good as it looked and
sounded this is a city that takes food
very seriously it's a pool of meat juice
I think is their secret and today we're
going on a Portuguese street food tour
to eat some of the tastiest sandwiches
in the city we'll also try a beloved
dish that's undoubtedly the king of all
sandwiches you barely even realize that
there's bread in the
sandwich wo that's like one massive
piece of pork I don't think anything
else will warm you up like a Fran get
ready to discover why Porto has some of
the greatest sandwiches in the
[Music]
world hey everyone hope you're having an
amazing day it's Mark wi welcome to the
beautiful city of Porto in Portugal this
is one of the sandwich capitals of the
world and today I'm hanging out with
Andre and Ricardo from taste Porto who
do some of the best Portuguese food
tours in Northern Portugal in Porto and
so we're in very very good hands they're
extremely passionate about authentic
Portuguese food and we have a lot of
sandwiches to eat so we're getting
started right now
Andre Ricardo very nice to meet you
what's the plan for today so we're GNA
start with breakfast we're going to go
to an Old Tavern called
shiku and we're going to see what
Delicacies they have there stored for us
today all right awesome thank you very
much welcome
to Old School Tavern at the city where
people just crash here for these
sandwiches and snacks and they have two
things that they're really known for and
they're P so smoked ham sandwich and Sal
sandish it's I'm going to call it a pork
neck uh smoke cut um that comes layered
like ham um uh really thin this gigantic
sandwich and we're going to go for that
awesome okay well this place is amazing
step in here there's a few tables along
the side but it's a lot of people just
stand the at the bar counter it is the
thing the aroma immediately in here you
just smell the aroma of the the ham
which is opens the appetite huh oh man
yes that mixes your mouth water
immediately and so these are all hams
that are hanging here and they use and
they're not just for display they're for
use as well uh and you can take a sneak
peek at the sandwiches already in the
back those are the BR so the ham that he
has up here and just take a note of the
size of the the layers there yeah that's
a that's a nice ratio
oh
yes
hello oh
yes
hello everything is sliced
fresh
so that's his own signature house
wine okay and we're going to go to the
the table over here in the
back yes
okay railing it the ham on okay and this
is my favorite the gigantic yeah oh you
smell all of that meat I'm okay the
cross-section oh yes look at that
ratio that's how we want a Sanders to be
yes pure smoked Tam and actually is
there anything else on it or is just
pure smoked ham just just bread ham no
seasonings no so that's like totally
focused all right cheers to begin the
sandwich tour cheers okay let's
go oh wow come on so soft and tender
it's just so much complexity of flavor
that says good morning like nothing
else oh man I think there's three pigs
here in one piece of bread
yeah oh oh
yeah
OHA oh it's a little bit
bubbly easy just to that goes great
together great together with the
ham
and I think what's amazing is the bread
is so it's crusty but really light so
just kind of cradles the the ham and
then because there's no other toppings
there's no other ingredients in it it
just totally focuses the flavor on the
ham that's all you're tasting I mean
that's all you need when the ham is that
good so many layers cut thin but then so
many layers like at least 20 layers of
ham in
there that is so
good and would this be common for
breakfast all times of the day for night
any 24 hours a day this is actually a
perfect snack and just get in get one
and you're done happiness then we also
got another sandwich that we have to try
here one thing I'm going to say up front
is before eating
it smell it all right because the most
intense scent that you're feeling here
is actually coming from
this Smokey meaty it's I would like to
have a air freshener like this at home
that would be awesome the greatest air
freshener I I would be always starving a
very good idea oh and so what exactly is
this type of meat so we call it
salie it's again pork usually
neck the meat is first
marinated in red wine bay leaf red wine
garlic and you can definitely feel those
in the palette yes now you say it yeah
and then it's w
wrapped dry aged and sometimes smoked
this one is smoked as well the smoking
stances can vary depending on the
producer um I would say that this is
perfectly balanced because it's not
chewy you can still feel the the smoke
kick in your palette but take a look at
this marbling it's just gorgeous look at
that and that Crush yeah that complexity
mild in Texture Intense in flavor okay
it's so good and yeah once you get to
that meat the fat and the skin has a
little bit of a chewier texture the meat
on the inside is just so tender truly
just spectacular natural
ingredients and then also a little
espresso for the day as well would you
like uh yeah well would you like an what
a spot and so friendly
okay they're so incredibly friendly oh
that was so
tasty oh wow I mean even after the first
stop we already are beginning to realize
why Porto is such a sandwich Capital but
we have a lot more sandwiches to
eat so conveniently just a 5 minute walk
away we're at the next place enough for
us to wear off uh all we burned all the
calories for sure no zero um I love the
fact that this one is just uh placed in
front of the train station which is
really convenient uh when you walk in
just immediately feel the flavors in the
air the Aromas are just tremendous
awesome bit spicy though um just to wake
you up okay excellent sounds
great here we are it's a huge honor to
be in the
kitchen starting theil stting how long
does it need to boil for so what exactly
is be oh so I'm going to call it a pork
Wonder a lot of people refer to it as uh
pulled pork I'm going to say definitely
pork shoulder belly thinly sliced and
this is the main difference to the
things that they do in Lisbon that they
claim are defer this is the real one so
thinly sliced then marinated for long in
wine garlic bay leaf uh some uh smoked
paprik has some chili pepper St going to
be feeling tingling excellent and then
cooked forong in those pants but the the
sauce the ingredients that I shared with
you um well they're my view into it to
to know the full recipe you have to
marry
them it is a guarded Family Recipe you
have to come here to try it so I mean
it's basically thin slices of pork which
are brazed and juices and paprika and
chili and wine and garlic and you just
the aroma in here is out of
control
okay
oh oh that smells so good the tender
pieces of pork the oily
juices oh with the
dip the dip at the end oh beauti
then
okay all right and that's a green green
soup kale soup a kale soup okay um it's
really simple actually the ingredient
list is quite short just potato onions
water and then shredded
KES yes okay oh so the kale goes in raw
nice okay the kale goes
in and then the broth the potato potato
broth
okay very nice
okay when it's well prepared it comes
with a side of this this is this is a
corn andry red and that thing is just
it's crusty on the outside but it's
doughy on the inside it's just delicious
all
right oh the whole thing goes
in
is always need to hydrate yep but we
have to start with the you have to start
with
this oh prepare to get dirty okay
hey
oh oh
wow feel that spicy cake it's kind of at
the back of your your
mouth the pork is so
tender the wine marinade you really
taste the wine
marinade and yeah then you do taste the
chili the spices in that secret liquid
brazing liquid and again the bread just
collapses So Soft so juicy and the pro
move is when she dips it into the oily
juice that just to burn the lips
over it's amazing that the the bread
remains crispy but kind of soggy where
the juices are but perfectly melts
together oh man that's good the beverage
of choice yeah
beer great combination wash this it down
excellent oh man that is that pork melts
in your
mouth wait wow that's good okay and then
we also have a few more dishes to try
here it's their secret St yes yeah is it
the different parts of the pig no this
actually actually chicken chicken
gizzards oh wow in the same juice
yeah and the proper Cutlery oh yes with
napkin
[Laughter]
included oh nice all right so as we're
standing here we got a special treat
let's go for
it toothpicks chicken gizzards in the
same juices as the as the
pork oh
wow oh that's so
good H tender gizzards you'll have
they're so proud and they should it's
just delish yeah that's that's delicious
I know that's
incredible this is like the most perfect
texture incredible taste that
juice it's okay to try the go for it so
it's a potato broth but the kale is kept
separately and then it's raw actually
when the soup goes in just wilted from
the hotness of the the potato
broth this is my first time to try
Portuguese
Calo oh that's delicious oh the
thickness of the potato broth the crunch
of the kale and the kale is not
overpowering it's not too green tasting
has a nice crunch to it it's really like
hearty and warming and you've just got a
a little bit of the flavor of the
meatiness from the is it a type of the
meat the chisu it's ch ch saage yeah it
can be a lot of things it really depends
on their choice their choice okay you
Dave yeah just a little bit of a metin
from the chiso in
there instead of adding salt into the
soup just add some chisu in and you're
covered that takes care of it oh this is
really good all right should we try the
last go for it the last sandwich okay
okay I'm going to skip it okay yeah sure
that's fine
so it's the Portuguese intake into a
schnitzel can either be pork or chicken
really okay I agree with her that says
that pork is more flavorful I believe so
as well that thing is just juicy
delish and again uh the
ratio of meat to bread the fried pork
cutlet overflowing over the bread the
bread is merely used as a little handle
for the pork
CET five honestly that's not because I
know places where the bun is this size
and the meat is this size so you
basically have literally so your fingers
don't touch the pork colet no you you
actually fold to put inside of the bread
then you eat so it's a double layer or
you eat it around you eat
around I love the love the ratios here
in
Porto oh yeah that's good that's I mean
classic simple the pork cutlet thin
breaded FR
Bean yeah you absolutely cannot go wrong
here this is the fourth generation here
totally family run and at the moment
there's three generations here at the
shop and we got here a little bit early
Ricardo and Andre were telling me that
if you come here at the peak of lunch
time it would be so packed you you need
to squeeze in it's hone and Raa at least
there will be more things in it this is
basically a we call it a digestive
digestive yeah it's it's still
Brewing they're friendliness and their
Hospitality we weren't we weren't
allowed to leave without a digestive I
know
sir pacing
pacing oh it's good though it is
[Music]
sweet
sweet really tastes the honey
honey yeah yeah it's good it's thick too
it is good but we still have a long day
ahead of
[Laughter]
us okay Astro another just outstanding
sandwich the original bana so we're
going to take the train into the town to
the next place and we're going to get
out actually on that famous train s okay
okay great extremely conveniently
located right across the street from the
train station so we'll just catch the
train into the center of
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Porto okay and here we are we've emerged
into the most iconic train station
beautiful but this one is the The
Landing dock when you get into the city
you get out here immediately the city's
Hearts uh and
[Music]
brains Porto is such a beautiful city
we're of course when you're here you'll
be walking up and down plenty of Hills
perfect for Food Tours cuz you get a you
burn a few calories as you
[Music]
eat
oh here we
are okay V hello v
v man this place is legendary and
absolutely pack this is their second
location uh but they have a bit more
space here and it's an absolute must
that you sit at the bar
counter get my y
my own so tell us about this
place so it's very difficult to speak
about this place this is the place
there's one next door that is actually
the mother of this one it's a little bit
smaller uh and it's the place when you
arrive you have to check their ends
doesn't matter what you're doing you
have to check your ends uh and there's
always this friendliness uh and people
just joking about everything it's famous
because of the the O dog um it's it's
not a common o dog you're going to seed
it's a very different thing I call it
Sushi because it comes in like sushi
rolls uh and one of the guys over there
is the mon he actually does cuts the the
bread blind blindfold of if you ask him
uh yeah it's just crazy that and beer
there nothing better so
awesome here's a fresh batch going in
yes okay so you can see it's a very thin
slice of a of a sausage plus a minced
meat sausage as well that's in the
center brushed with butter oh what a
move and then compressed and
toasted oh man that toasts until it
caramelizes then he puts on the cheese
and The Griddle goes directly onto the
cheese so that's going to melt that's
going to Brown the cheese on that hot
iron griddle what a
technique oh this is Porto UNESCO right
here
preparing for the
camera oh they so friendly
too okay that's been toasted okay now
the top half of the bread comes on oh
and it's already been toasted pre-
toasted as well you can see how crispy
it is okay now that goes on the
[Music]
top
ready ready oh slicing
okay
who
machine
machine
the final step once they're ready he
chops it up with his motor hands he's
like a hand chainsaw he chops it up into
bite-sized pieces onto a plate with a
Sprinkle of chili oil on top oh that
process of how they make it is
incredible and as I was watching him
make it one of the coolest moves he does
is that he actually Sears the
cheese on that hot iron without the bun
first to sear that cheese before the top
bun goes on that's impressive and then
also the the slicing is also impressive
where he just he's like a
chainsaw skills in that yes and I'll be
sure to let you know he has all of his
fingers
intact he does okay we can't talk
anymore oh so they're like literally
little
bite-sized oh
wow oh that that is that's as good as it
looked and sounded oh man the bread it
gets at least three Coatings of butter
throughout the cooking process which is
all strategic as well that's why it's so
crispy the linguisa sausage the minc
meat sausage the sear of the cheese oh
man that's that is
something
spectacular oh
wow
that's as good
as snack or street food fast food As
Good As It
Gets Cheers
Cheers oh that combination I
know you guys know how to do it in
PTO that is man well I mean it's not
exactly a hot dog it's more than a hot
dog it's a magical Porto Wonder so this
is their version of a prgo you know what
prgo means in Portuguese no nail oh
really basically like a nail really the
trick is they always get a rum steak
they beat it with an Hammer just to make
it Ultra Soft then they Grill it and
then a little bit of pepper and salt at
the end uh cheese ham and then bread of
course the bun okay yes it's just packed
packed in there
[Music]
oh
wow steak ham and cheese so soft so
tender M amazing that is a genious
combination oh man you really taste the
meat the quality of the steak the cheese
is more kind of neutral tasting it's not
too strong and not overpowering and the
ham just gives it some saltiness and
some
depth
oh man the sandwich construction the
engineering of these sandwiches it's
just it's
Perfection wow that's
good even though it looks small it's
kind of feel filling because of the
richness of it narrowly
tasty
yes some of the friendliest people yes
incredible oh man stepping outside is
like coming out of a movie theater it's
one of those you feel like you're like
you're in another
world oh again I mean everywhere we've
been the the warmth and hospitality is
what stands out along with the food the
sandwiches that was something truly
world
class this is Kaz famous for their pork
leg Sanders right there waiting for
mive roasted pork leg in the cabinet and
it's absolutely juicy delicious it's an
icon of the city people just up in
Sandwich uh either a glass of beer or
they have their own sparkling wine their
production we're going to try both to
see how it goes and I've asked for an
regular one which is plain just the pork
like there and then one with cheese
inside then famous C the in just to
Juicy up the thing okay oh man what an
unbelievable process he has the entire
roasted pork leg and he just carefully
slices off pieces very thinly it drops
below into a pool it's literally a a tub
a pool of the oily meat juices which it
then rests in which it then absorbs
keeping it juicy as it stays there the
bread is toasted you can get it with
cheese or without cheese and then he
lays in that crispy pork tosses on some
of that meat
juice
and then squeezes it out before serves
it on a plate what a sandwich that is oh
man it's this is the ultimate meat juice
sandwich I'm beginning to realize that
in Porto or in Portugal you needed a
drink with every meal a beverage just to
wash it down really because of all the
spices it's a
mandatory my liver and my stomach are
having a
debate it's not a at least it's a happy
[Laughter]
one it's a good debate to have oh really
all the uzi cheese okay so they've taken
roast pork to the next level that's a
pool of meat juice I think is their
secret it is that sauce it brings all of
the flavors together I would say even
tosses some of the juice into the bread
before kind of ringing it out a little
bit so all that juice sticks into the
into the bread before putting it onto
your plate and then it gives it a hand
smash as well which is also a very cool
move we got two different versions one
is just just the pork one is with the
cheese which has started to literally
liquefy with the heat of the pork so
yeah should we try the maybe the
original first before we before we move
on to
[Music]
cheese oh wow almost like a confe of
pork all that ju oh oh that that's
success right there if you drip a little
bit look at that they actually two kinds
of pork atems yeah it's the crispy bits
the outside and then the thin tender
inside oh it's oh okay so it takes a
slice of that slice of it plus the the
drippings and the the skin outer
side
wow extremely tender like the pork is
actually kind of lean lean but that
gives it the texture I do want
to try some of this pey pey chili oil
okay go easy on it oh yeah okay A little
drizzle oh huh oh yeah oh that's so good
that get you tingling huh that gives you
a burst of flavor oh yeah it's so fruity
too it is has this acidity to it here's
another bottle he handed me I'm not sure
if it's the same thing or a probably a
little bit more explosive more explosive
yeah excellent don't shake don't shake
oh oh wow the pey pey just takes it to
the next level no it does oh well let's
have a a ship before we move on to the
chees palet cleanser P cleanser anosa
anosa oh wait fresh Light it's
refreshing yeah yeah it's a sparkling
sparkling wine yeah brute uh made just
for them nice
[Music]
nice okay now we have the cheese version
just look at the way the cheese has just
melted stuck together with the cheese
but oo oh so Oozy oh
man
oh that gives it another dimension it
does the creaminess
and the cheese is not Bland at all the
cheese is quite
intense so so creamy yeah but it's not
overlapping there it's adding an extra
layer of flavor yeah definitely and
richness and
calories the good ones though yes much
needed calories
oh oh
yes
no that is that's actually like he's
just sh off oh he's just sh off I'm
going to use little bit on mine oh that
is so good
oh man that just yeah tingles your your
tongue a little bit the the condensed
flavor of the
chilies oh wow that's
outstanding even if you inhale a little
bit get some of those chili fumes kind
of going into the back of your
throat oh that PE is good wow and what a
sandwich I'm starting to warm up huh I
don't know if it's the pey pey or the or
the calories the meat sweats
yeah they're coming we we're quite a few
sandwiches deep so
far they're very
happy another absolute
Sensational
Landmark institution why is Porto such
an incredible sandwich City PTO has a
big connection with industrial period
and with all the industri industry
settling around PTO there's a lot of
people that will live outside of the
city would come to work and then at the
end of the day before going back home
they needed something to eat uh and then
this is basically a a trial error thing
you try to put something on piece of
bread and things works I always think
about Darwinism of food okay that is
some survive some don't and today the
examples we have was basically someone
tried to do something and comes from
very humble origins in places like this
that now they are getting a bit of
upscaled but the places where we seen
today are basically the reflection of
something that is very pure with very
simple ingredients back in the 1850s
1870s places like this the industrial
city work working class families they
needed uh options these places counter
like this um maybe a couple of wine
barrels in the back maybe even some beer
back then and then these sandwiches
being prepared and you would arrive at a
place like this sand glass of wine and
off your way uh and today you still feel
the Echoes of such tradition because
these places are sealed all over all
over
town
oh that was another spectacular sandwich
in
[Music]
Porto oh man one of the great things
about Porto is you could be so
productive on a food tour there's so
much food in such a small amount of
space and our next sandwich is just a 5
to 7 minute walk away gives us plenty of
time to burn at least three calories
before the next sandwich
well I hope you're enjoying this
ultimate sandwich tour in Porto and
we're beginning to realize why it is the
sandwich capital of Portugal one of the
sandwich capitals of the world and we
still have a few more sandwiches to eat
including the king of all sandwiches but
if you're enjoying this video please
remember to give it a thumbs up and also
I'd love to hear your comments in the
description box below okay we're just
arrived to the next
sandwich so we're now at K spray
um it's one of those places that I feel
at home um they change the daily
specials but their psh their tiny plates
are just delicious but coming here for
one of their main courses is just
worthwhile walking all these 7 minutes
to arrive here it's an amazing venue and
they have sandwiches here too and they
also have sandwiches actually we're
going to try one of their sandwiches and
a few other of their
perfect
oh oh it looks like a liver sauce almost
soup it's a soup okay yeah meat oh from
wheat okay okay soup okay thank

pork can I slice it oh it's

delicious
my soul is so
happy oh
hot oh

daily specials hu is a chick beu with
pasta in all kinds of pork guts here fat
chisu as well carrots bacon is it pasta

enjoy this this looks
warming as it looks everything just
melts in your mouth from the pork to the
pasta to the chickpeas to the carrot
oh it's a Harmony of of mellow
comforting
flavors and
pig oh that is deliciously
warming and Hearty and every now and
then you get a a bit of a piece of pork
some cartilage
bits some crunchy bits
that's outstanding this is one of my
favorite we have liver oh this is a
things that brings a lot of polarity
into tables because you either love it
or ate it uh and to do it
properly uh it's a whole liver liver
steak okay so a liver steak with a lot
of onions uh oh man oh thank you the
onions actually will eliminate a little
bit of that Rusty flavor that's
[Music]
okay oh yeah the hint of sourness from
the vinegar mhm the onions have a little
bit of a crunch to them so sweet mhm the
liver is yeah it's not really irony at
all it's really sweet a little bit
crumbly absorb the flavor of the onions
that is another delicious
dish
[Music]
for our next sandwich I think we have
reached the Pinnacle I don't think it
gets more unbelievable sandwich than
this this is the king of all
[Music]
sandwiches we said red one okay
linguisa and this is the sauce uh a
little bit Blends uh and then it's
almost like a soup you're going put it
on top of okay and most of the people
now put not with whole fried egg theg
actually to bring some
extra actually cut
fries that coming out of the oven the
cheese has melted that goes back to the
other side of the kitchen oh the fried
egg goes on the proteins just never
stop oh
wow oh the
sauce wow okay complete yes open
go wow here we go Mark meet Fran Fran
meet Mark uh
fra has everything in so in between two
loaves of bread you get grilled rum
steak um a fresh sausage lingua then ham
cheese covered with milk cheese fried
egg on top a side of fries and some
extra sauce because you will need extra
sauce man oh it's a light
2500 calorie Ricardo knows already he's
already pouring on more sauce ice cream
should be a floating island of a
floating island I like that a floating
island and Ricardo what were you saying
is mainly in the sauce so there's a lot
of ingredients in it but uh it's a
mostly a secret too everyone has its own
secret in this place actually U the
secret is not going to be passed on uh
soon
oh oh and the yolk just oozes out so is
this a a daily meal in
Porto it used to be a weekly meal uh
when I was younger not today actually I
will I was called it already when I got
in it's like you're missing your
practice okay so you get a bite a
cross-section with a little bit of
everything all 12 all 12 Meats really
let it absorb absorb that sauce oh the
steak I almost forgot about the steak
don't forget about the
cheese
you got to like so texture cuz this
is yeah that's the the epitome of a soy
sandwich mhm that's so
good put fries on it yeah and then once
you have a little space on your plate
then you start loading in the fries
mhm looks like there's always more sauce
there should be oh now we go for the
fries if things could not get better
you still got the crispiness of the
fries oh the starchiness of them but
they just start to absorb that sauce
with that tomato with that complexity of
the
wine oh that's so warming calorie rich
and just fulfilling fulfilling to the
max oh what a
sandwich like you barely even realize
that there's bread in the sandwich which
is overpowered by the sauce and the
meats oh man that's yeah that's as good
as everyone says it is would you say
this is one of the the Prides of PTO oh
definitely whenever we we think about
Port there are a couple of things that
come to mind immediately and this is
number one on my list it's just it
defines it's not just the food it's the
fact that you have to have it in a place
like this with a counter like that sit
down with your friends or just on your
own sitting at the counter um asking for
one of this and then just talking to
whoever's next to you and that's that's
that's PTO right there when it's
dripping full of sauce you know that's a
that's a good
bite I don't think anything else will
warm you up like a
frania that
is superb it's like really every protein
you can imagine all combined between two
pieces of bread toasted multiple times
with cheese and fries and just a warming
sauce yeah that's
unbelievable oh when you get some drips
down the
chin I think that's the only way to do
it oh a soggy sandwich has never tasted
so good in your
life oh wow thank
you amazing thank you thank you oh it's
been definitely a rainy and cool day in
Porto but we have most definitely
figured out the secret as to why Porto
is such an incredible sandwich City it
has to do with the history trial and
error testing different combinations and
let me tell you they have figured that
out it's one of the great sandwich
hitties in the world I want to say a
huge thank you to my friends Andre
Ricardo from taste Porto they operate
the best Porto Food Tours highly highly
recommended when you come to Porto and
I'll have their information in the
description box below and I want to say
a big thank you to you for watching this
video please remember to give it a
