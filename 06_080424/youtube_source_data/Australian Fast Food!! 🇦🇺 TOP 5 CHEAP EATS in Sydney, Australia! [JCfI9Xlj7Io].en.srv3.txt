iconic legendary Cheap Eats of Sydney
[Music]
we're beginning this cheap eats tour in
Merrickville and it's a little ways
outside of the center of Sydney there's
a big Vietnamese population here
so the first place we're going is the
original one of the most iconic bun me
sandwiches pork rolls in all of Sydney
and it used to be in this little tiny
closet sized shop right here but then I
think uh they expanded to the next door
location so now there's still a Juice
Shop here but the pork roll sandwich is
next door
the original with everything
pork roll yes chili original with chili
and crispy pork as well
does it come with oh okay okay maybe we
can do two then one is the pork roll and

how long have you been open
here for 13 years 13 years and was it

so the original Merrickville pork roll
this place is so iconic and Sydney I
mean they're known for bun me bun me is
so popular people have just huge
followings for banmi and this place is
one of the places that started it all
with the pork roll they actually they're
really nice here and then I decided to
order two different versions one is the
original pork roll which comes with all
the Vietnamese ham and all of the
different cold cuts uh deli meats and
then another one which is the crispy
pork roll which is more of a crispy pork
belly which goes into the roll but one
of the incredible things here is just
this they have this mountain of fresh
herbs and vegetables and a small
mountain of Pate but there's coriander
there's onions there's pickled carrots
there's mixed vegetables it's an
impressive display of all the toppings
and ingredients and I think one of the
great things is they're so generous with
the ingredients they just pile things
into your roll okay
all right thank you very much
here we go let's try let's see what we
get first wow that's heavy that's fully
fully packed
or or it's it's huge I think we're
starting with the pork roll the original
bread is so crispy and then it's big but
you can tell it's light at the same time
there's chilies all the pickled
vegetables the carrots the radish the
green onions the coriander and there's a
variety of porks and Vietnamese hams
onions in there
um
oh it's so good it's so
there's so many toppings so many things
going on in there oh nice chili in there
you got the freshness of the Cucumber
the carrots you got that pickle flavor
and then the the combination
the bread is extremely crispy but so
light and Airy and puffy all at the same
time and then that combination of the
Pate the mayonnaise
just makes the perfect
moisture
layer that just keeps it so juicy all
the way through
I'm gonna move
I mean I've had
the amazing bun me in Saigon which are
similar to this but this is a little bit
of the the owners their own style I mean
taking on that but then the way they
make it and that mountain of vegetables
oh this is just a like absolute classic
delicious no wonder it's so highly rated
why so many people love it dedicated to
the pork roll here at Merrickville
now we need to try the crispy Fork come
back up let's do a switch
thank you
so Mike has been Michael's been already
enjoying the crispy pork crispy pork
belly roll oh look at the insides of
that so it has crispy pork belly
loaded in there there's also the pate
and mayonnaise mixture plus all the
vegetables put some chilies in there
huge slices of cucumber
some Pac-Man Mariners on my
okay
we're definitely going to have a pate
mustache when you eat this but
um
you have the Smoky roasted flavor of the
pork belly a little bit of the crispy
edges and then all of the refreshing
herbs as well I love the Cucumbers thick
cut and huge one slice of cucumber fills
the entire roll
a little bit of chili in there you've
got the the acidity of the pickles which
contrasts the richness of the pork belly
then all wrapped up in that crispy roll
delicious you can't go wrong a bun me
like this a sandwich okay so it's like
if you come here here even if you're not
hungry like you'll still eat the whole
thing and it will go down so easily it's
like deceivingly
light and fluffy yet fulfilling
we're off to a great start that was
extremely tasty we're moving on to the
next cheap eat
next up on this cheap eats tour of
Sydney we're in an area that's called
Asheville and we're on our way to a
kebab shop to eat something that is
extremely iconic uh this is one of the
the things I was most looking forward to
eating in this entire food tour and the
Kebab shops should be somewhere
somewhere just down the road
[Music]
welcome to Metro One Kebab shop and we
are here to eat something called the
Halal snack pack or HSP for short
oh so that hot meat melts the cheese
based on Turkish Cuisine but it's kind
of a thing that was started right here
in Sydney it's an Australian it's a like
iconic takeout staple of Australia and
especially in Sydney
and so she starts with fries chips that
are fried and that makes the base you
can choose oh one more thing is that you
can choose
from like eight different sizes all the
way from kids size to regular to large
to nine inch to 11 inch 13 inch 15 inch
pizza box an entire pizza box of a Halal
Snack Pack I went with the the large
size which is one of the classic sizes
uh but they start with a base of french
fries then I got the mix of meat so a
mix of chicken as well as beef uh which
he then griddle fries that goes over the
fries and then on top three different
sauces the garlic sauce the barbecue
sauce the chili sauce all that is heavy
thank you very much
thank you
hot warm gooey Saucy it's so heavy oh I
forgot about the cheese there's cheese
melted
oh there's so much going on
oh fully loaded the cheese
um
oh
oh wow yes
oh that
got everything I was expecting it to be
and more those hot freshly cooked crispy
fries the cheese the layer of cheese
which I had totally forgotten about just
melted on top the meat on the spit then
griddle fried then draped
all the Kebab Meats
and then all of those sweet and sour and
slightly spicy sauces the garlic
chili sauce the barbecue sauce
oh man that's tasty
one of the great things is that they
cook it all hot and fresh
so much meat on top of it so much cheese
so much sauces it's moist it's gooey as
we continue to eat this I do want to
tell you a little bit of a story of how
this was invented and how it became so
popular here in Australia because there
are I mean around the world I think
there are variations that are similar to
this but also a little bit different
from what I'm reading a little bit about
their history it can be traced back to
the 1980s and you know it has origins in
Turkish food with the Middle Eastern
Community in Sydney that began I mean
adapting to the local culture adapting
also to the European influence in Sydney
to come up with this dish but as the
story goes it wasn't until about 2015
there was a there was actually a
Facebook group here in Sydney called the
Halal snack appreciation society that
began
talking and creating a buzz around Halal
snack packs reviewing Halal snack packs
uh rating them really bringing cultures
together through this dish I think
through the Facebook group through the
the talking about Halal snack packs it
led one of the the Australian
Senators Sam dastyari
was in the Australian Parliament to hold
the debate about Halal certification and
halal food and that's what's what's also
created a buzz and created a more of an
awareness about Halal food in Sydney and
the Halal snack packs so here we are
today it is a staple an iconic dish
something that you absolutely have to
try when you come to Sydney
the better it gets the fries get a
little soggier saturated with the meat
juice and sauces and the cheese oil
thank you very much thank you thank you
very much nice to meet you also
hsps would be available at any basically
any Kebab shop throughout Sydney that
you can find like the place that we went
to is called Metro One Kebab highly
recommended when I was doing research
about the best HSP in Sydney uh this
consistently ranked as one of the best
with a lot of loyal fans customers and
now I can see why huge portion sizes
good quality ingredients really friendly
service it was outstanding and that
entire box cost 20 dollars so but it's
huge and she did put two forks in it so
I think it could be considered for two
people it's a it's a sharing Snack Pack
I would highly recommend it okay we're
moving on we've got a lot more food to
eat
thank you
next up we took the train out to an area
of town that's called Granville it was
about a 30 minute train ride out of town
into the suburbs of Sydney and I wanted
to especially come the restaurant that
we're going to they have a few locations
around town now but I especially wanted
to come out here because I believe this
is where the original location is
welcome to El Jannah this restaurant is
an institution in city started back in
1998 but they have multiple locations
across town now and it's a Lebanese
Australian charcoal roasted chicken is
what you come here for although they
have Fried Chicken on their menu too I
you know I believe it's developed it's
changed it's almost run like a fast food
restaurant now where you get of all your
food at the front and they have some
seeding a lot of takeaway orders but uh
you walk in here you can immediately
smell the aroma of that charcoal chicken
warning you may eat more chicken than
planned that's perfectly normal
okay so we're getting an exclusive look
in the grill room here at El Jannah it's
an amazing I mean they have capacity to
do
how many chickens could you do at once
here in one cheese week before four
chickens per sheet yeah it's busy
especially during weekends old school
all full yeah
oh look at that action spring when the
Fire gets too hot and that's incredible
but there's three car sized grills going
down it's just a fiery furnace just the
coals are so hot and then the they have
an automatic rotisserie on a Little
Engine That continuously spins them so
that's how they get that incredible Char
on the skin the smokiness the fat drips
down and the smoke comes up and just
embeds into the meat wow what a what a
grill room
oh fresh chickens
okay
[Music]
oh man it was an honor to spend some
time back here in the pits of el Jannah
they wrote the roasting chicken is
unbelievable that's a fresh batch
they're ready to be served and so when
you eat here I mean you're just
guaranteed hot fresh charcoal roasted
chicken
thank you very much thank you very much
thank you yeah that charcoal chicken
smells so good and it's so cool that
this place aljana is a fast food
restaurant but it's a it's its own
homegrown restaurant right here out of
Sydney Lebanese in ethnicity and origin
but then truly developed right here in
Sydney Australia that chicken looks
incredible oopsie spilled the fries and
the fries I Believe come with uh their
own chicken salt as well we got pickles
we've got the garlic sauce we got bread
underneath it
oh yes look at that chicken look at that
skin it's so bubbly and puffy and crispy
okay I got half a chicken so I got the
breast and the thigh drumstick in one
side oh oh should we just tear this open
it's so crispy
oh I bet it's so juicy and hot on the
center
let's just bite into it
[Music]
okay
[Music]
oh wow that's tasty
you immediately taste the flavor of the
charcoal the smoke in the chicken
the skin is so crispy it's almost the
crispiness of it being deep fried it's
actually because you have the fat
reacting to that hot charcoal
I think he taste a little bit of that
chicken salt that maybe has been
sprinkled well on the fries for sure
maybe a little bit on the chicken as
well or did that happen when I spilled
the fries
but anyway it's just like a really
clean smoky
chicken with crispy skin and with the
meat leaving the meat really moist
pickles I've heard a lot of good things
about the the garlic sauce and then
let's tear in for a for a piece of bread
let's try that garlic sauce
and I do remember being in Lebanon and
eating the roast chicken it always has
to be eaten with garlic sauce and some
of the greatest garlic sauce you'll ever
eat in your life
oh with that garlic sauce
oh man that's creamy so rich so fluffy
and creamy and dense actually and then
immediately you taste that garlicky
Aroma while that's good with the roasted
Smoky chicken next up let's try it with
with bread
try that chicken breast
break off
break off a piece
so moist and juicy in the center add on
some of these bright pickles
squeeze on a little bit of that garlic
sauce
oh it's so thick
it's so thick a piece of chicken got
stuck in it from my last dip
again the smokiness of the cooking
the richness of that garlic sauce and
then I like it with the pickles the
acidity to just contrast to break down
the richness of that sauce all of the
flavors complementing together
[Music]
excellent okay and now we do have the
fridge which are coated you can if you
look closely you can see the fries are
sprinkled with a special seasoning which
I believe is a chicken Salt which is
quite famous here as well
oh yeah immediately
it tastes like a combination of salt
Plus Dry chicken powder seasoning
coating the fries giving them a little
bit of extra flavor to add to the full
chicken grilled chicken experience
charcoal chicken experience oh even the
chicken breast is nice and juicy
maybe dip it into the garlic sauce then
into into bread and then add pickles and
actually to make it even take it to the
next level you could definitely add some
fries as well
um
yeah that's just I mean
I think one of the reasons it's so
popular is it's just a meal everybody
can enjoy everybody in the family it's
laid back it's fast it's fresh it's
tasty I already did mention they have a
number of locations around Sydney maybe
even Australia and they have some that
are closer to town within the central
business district but I just have this
thing
especially when I travel I love to go to
the original location I mean even though
the locations I'm sure they all pretty
much have the same exact food maybe the
same taste for me somehow coming to the
original location gives it more meaning
and more history and then maybe the
taste even is the best
thank you very much
so welcome to Central Sydney we're right
in the CBD as they call it that Central
business district at town hall and this
is the I mean the center of business and
this is where the heart of Sydney is we
are on our way to an area which is
called Haymarket which is known for its
Asian population and its abundance of
delicious Asian restaurants which is uh
should be right up ahead and we're going
to be at the next restaurant oh I can
smell the noodles I can smell the
dumplings we're at the next place
yeah
so welcome to Chinatown noodle
restaurant this place is so iconic and
even as I was standing outside on the
sidewalk for a little bit I met a few
local people who said this is their
favorite place for noodles in Sydney I
love how the menu here is giant red on
the wall you could just see everything
they have clear printed on the wall this
place is called Chinatown Noodle
Restaurant They're known for their
noodles and their dumplings

kitchen we're gonna see them as they
make the hand pulled stretch the noodles
um and they have the noodles in a coil
already and then she just like stretches
it out with her fingers into a couple of
different uh strands but they're like
very strategic and now she's gonna she's
gonna hand pull them we're gonna see the
process before they then get fried into
the stir-fried noodles
[Music]
for those noodles she just slaps them
out on the table just releasing all of
the air bubbles and just stretching them
out then they go directly into a
bubbling walk and they say they're gonna
boil for about five minutes
foreign
okay that batch of noodles is ready
foreign
thank you very much very good
[Music]
butter donut
okay that's the eggplant okay cheers

okay let's start with those noodles
fresh out of the wok
oh man they're thick they're hearty
they're boiled and then stir-fried that
sauce chicken bell peppers in there wow

but they really slide in the Chopsticks
okay
and you can actually hear them in the
kitchen they're slapping out the noodles
fresh they boil and then stir fry
oh wow oh that's so good
oh man the doughy gooeyness of the
noodles the texture the thickness the
hardiness and then stir-fried and
extremely hot oil
so they have that smokiness that breath
of the walk to them with the seared soy
sauce so fragrant that's so good
um

to be delicious I will stick some of
this
onto my
my plate though
and then I will
season
with some
chili oil
oh yes bump up that chili
oh yes
oh wow
put the extra chili oil
that texture that flavor is incredible
okay braised eggplant oh huge pieces of
eggplant
braised

they're melting
oh look if you squeeze all the eggplants
literally just just melting and it's
melting in my Chopsticks it's falling
apart
oh that's hot
wow
you should not put an entire piece of
eggplant in your mouth at once
in farm Dutch eggplant on fire
um
but it literally just melts in your
mouth
but it's crispy on the edges
and then the inside is so gooey with
disintegrate and then it's a little bit
sweet so it's that Sugar that's just
been caramelized that is really soft and
tender and really tasty

thick meaty doughy wrappers that are so
like warming
oh that's fully loaded that's so tasty
and then
have some tea
and then the final dish we got is
dumplings and chili oil
this is a different kind of dumpling and
then in that chili oil soup so I think
we better maybe we should take a bite of
The Dumpling with the Chopsticks and
then Chase with some of that chili oil
broth
oh
or hot
oh
yes
it was just like hot oil just squirted
out into my mouth oh that was incredible
they're so juicy they've just absorbed
become saturated with that chili oil
oh and I want to taste that broth so bad
oh
boiling chili oil vinegar in there
coriander Sichuan pepper immediately a
little bit numbing but it's more of that
citrusy fragrance that's so good
oh and it's a totally different wrapper
from the The Boiled dumplings The Boiled
dumplings is more of a doughy wrapper
and this is more of a silky one ton
wrapper both extraordinary everything
here is good
a few things in the world are as
satisfying
as a player played a home homemade stir
fried noodles like that man it's Shogun
um
you can taste the handmade quality of
the freshness
and that is really what stands out as
well
oh what a meal and these are not like
little portions these are Big portions

it mostly northern northern Chinese or
where does your family come from
okay okay oh great the food is amazing
thank you very much thank you
oh that was extraordinary and the owner
here is so nice such a nice guy the
staff are really friendly as well again
I didn't even have plans I mean to to
film here in the kitchen but they were
just so gracious to allow me in the
kitchen to see the process and making
the noodles fresh so friendly
highly recommended that was
wow that was so good so hearty
oh okay we have one more place to go to
on this cheap eats ultimate food tour of
Sydney
next up we are in Paddington and we're
going to a place uh it's called Indian
home Diner they specialize in cut it
Bobs I know they have chicken tikka but
they're really are popular for their
wraps with different sauces Indian
sauces
welcome to Indian home Diner really nice
cozy place I love how they have
everything here ready at the front they
have all the different curries ready
that you could choose from they have
none available they have samosas and
they have chicken tikka now you could
get a variety of different curries but
one of the most popular things to do on
the menu is to choose your own Kebab
which they have some of the classic
mixtures with chicken tikka which is
wrapped into a really puffy naan then
you get your choice of different curry
sauce which then goes on and then you
can wrap it up I I immediately had to go
for the double Tikka Indian Kebab so
that's double the amount of chicken
tikka and what she does is she grabs one
of the puffy nuns adds on some of that
curry sauce and then takes the chicken
tikka and then just kind of like mashes
it into the nun then you get a choice of
either a potato fried potato Fritter or
a fried onion Fritter in that just
smashed down into the chicken and then
you get mint sauce all over it great
concept I mean like a roll
fully loaded oh it smells so good
all right and there it is
cool thank you very much thank you very
much
oh it's aluminum
lined to keep it nice and hot
and then wrapped again got the double
whoa I don't think I want to unwrap it
all the way though
oh it's fully loaded
got the double chicken tikka all of that
vindaloo sauce the mint sauce oh man
fully loaded oh that's warm and thick
and
okay can't wait to try this
[Applause]
[Music]
um
oh yeah
oh that is tasty and my favorite move is
how they how they make it they cut no
knives are used they use the the tongs
to just slice the chicken and the bajria
with the sauce and then they roll it up
wrap it up they stuff it with the tongue
still inside of your non-wrap and then
they bag it up and then pull out the
Tong's last to hold it together what a
move
um
oh you can taste the cumin seed
it's just warm it's hearty
that is delicious
on that bite I got a big piece of that
it's onion bhajia crispy until it's a
batter there's the onions you know I
think it might have been really good
with a potato cutlet but I mean I don't
think it can go wrong actually
the vindaloo sauce which they said is
very spicy
a little bit spicy but it is flavorful
and again a little bit of a cumin seed
flavor and turmeric flavor to it
I think the only thing is the shot
starts to absorb so it'll be I mean
it'll be a little extra but to have a
little bit of sauce on the side the
vindaloo sauce to then just drizzle on
top as you take bites
that would take it to the next level
chicken tikka really tender Smoky this
is extremely satisfying
flavorful and everything wrapped up into
the naan so it's easy to eat
dollar Church
and then one thing I wanted to mention
about the price I got I think it was 15
I got the double Tico so that was two
times the amount of chicken tikka but I
mean I'm I wanted it to be full and
blooming
but you can also just get the classic
the normal one Tikka which is 11 I
believe
I'll have all five of the places that we
went to on the Sydney cheap each tour in
the description box below you can check
them all out people have been so
