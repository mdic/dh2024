we are currently in Washington DC and we
wanted to do a restaurant review at the
Hamilton it looks like it's a very
popular spot here in Washington DC and
we have a reservation for 7:00 it's just
a little bit after 600 so not much
longer and we will get to go try it
looking forward to this one starving
cold cold ready to eat let's go check it
[Music]
out
now like I mentioned we did get a
reservation through open table and I
would highly recommend getting a
reservation cuz I I think it's usually
pretty busy here it
is it's right here on it's right across
from the Willard office and I think it's
located on 14th and F Street the
Hamilton eat drink
listen
14th and 14th Street Northwest they do
have the menu out here in front but
we'll do a detailed menu when we get
inside now online it said there is no
dress code which is kind of nice they
said you can dress up you can just wear
your casual clothes do whatever you need
to do but uh we're going to head right
inside here oh thank you I'm not
sure what the hours are in here I'll
have to look at that also but um we're
going to see if we can get in a little
early we might not be able to here's the
bar over
here this looks so nice this is where
you would uh check in right here uh
restrooms I'll have to find somewhere
but man it's it's nice in here floor is
pretty
[Music]
cool I can't wait to eat here I'm so
excited so he said that he can can get
us in in 30 minutes so um we can
actually get in at 6:30 instead of 7:00
so that's nice cuz it is very cold
outside it feels like 30 37 or 36 right
now and it's very windy so about 30
minutes we'll just stand around and uh
get to do a review here
soon now my mom just uh asked where the
restroom is at and she went that way
through this doorway so I'm guessing
they're somewhere over
there I just can't get over how cool it
looks in here apparently this place is
huge so we got to go to the restroom
while we're waiting and he said go this
way take a
right down here
probably this place is massive look at
this take a right another
bar then you take a left excuse me oh
look at
this and then oh you head straight down
here look at how big this
is oh yeah look at all the
wines another dining
area and restrooms are all the way back
here they also have the Loft straight
ahead up to the
right turn right here here we have the
restrooms is there like a downstairs
too man this place is just
massive lots of wines Timber said the
space downstairs that we showed is for
live music pretty cool now they do offer
Uber Eats and as far as hours go it's
11:00 a.m. to 2 a.m. they have a menu
you can get after 11:00 p.m. it's
currently 6:40 so hopefully we will get
texted anytime but you can see it does
does fill up and get really
crowded it's currently 6:47 so I'm not
thinking we're going to really get in
much earlier than our reservation cuz
look at this crowd here now up front
they have a sign that says no
cash so I just got a text at 652 our
table is
ready all right we are going this way
look at these little like private door
booths those are
nice looks like we are going to be over
here maybe oh sweet we're over here at
the
end this is a good Booth here um they
got a little coat hanger and again this
is what it looks like now they have a
very large drink menu you can see 26
pages
long so I'm going to go pretty quick
with it here
here are some
wines seasonal
cocktails seasonal
cocktails there's zero
proof oh look at that one apple of my
eye drinks
beer Selter
beer Wines By the
bottle there is one for $335 if you'd
like Wines By the
bottle

wines and guess what more wines and some
more then we have dessert and fortified
wines some just alcohol
[Music]
liquor I mean this is a massive drink
menu good
grief
finally we've almost made it to the end
of the drink
menu there we have
it 26
Pages now I think as far as drinks go I
might just do the unsweet Arnold Palmer
but let's have a look at the
menu I'm going to just kind of go like
this so we have I'll go here for
starters
American Farmhouse
cheese
Cherie there's some symbols down there
vegetarian and gluten
friendly over here we have
greens
Entre Steaks and Chops f and Fish
Market housemade
pasta over here
burgers served with french fries fruit
mixed green salad or Caesar
salad
sandwiches the Rachel that's kind of
like a
Ruben here are some sides truffle
Rosemary
fries there's the executive chef and
enal
manager and then on this
side
Sushi there's Sushi happy hour 7 days a
week $5 off sushi roll those are the
times then we've got um here are some of
the
rolls some more
rolls vento
platters concert count
CER there you have it so they give you a
full thing of water here we're going to
go ahead and try the water I'm sure it's
delicious though is it good here's the
water yeah that's really good water I
think we we might get some bread and
butter to try it so just make note of
what's served with a side you have the
fish market is Steaks and Chops are and
then up here burgers are this is my
first Washington DC arold old Palmer and
it is very tasty I think we're going to
do bread and
butter either the Sherie board or this
cheese board Timber and I are going to
share the shrimp
Linguini my Dad's getting the Hamilton
Burger my mom's getting the classic
cheeseburger and we're going to try some
of that and then we might end up doing a
dessert here is a look at the dessert
menu warm brownie
sunde and then they do
have coffee and tea so with the shery
board and the cheese than
you you got the cheddar yes I don't
remember you could mix and match you
could do one in one so we did the
cheddar and then we did the uh soap and
S the salami yeah the two complaints
we'd have right now is a little loud and
it did take an extremely long time to
get this out I mean it probably took
like 15 20 minutes at least and we still
haven't gotten our bread for from the
appetizer either but here is the cheese
here is the
shuder and we're going to give both of
them a try it's really not that much uh
cheese and here's what the bread looks
like everything has been really good
though just for a current update it is
currently 88:18 and um still haven't
gotten our food yet just to prove what
time it is it's 8:23 and still no food
and it feels like 32Â° outside it does
feel like 32 de possibility of snow they
are just delivering the food right now
and it's
8:26 hello
hello here's a look at the Hamilton
burger with a side
salad here's a look at the regular
burger with pepper jack and a side salad
and then they ended up splitting hours
which it's a good portion I'm just
curious if they are going to charge for
splitting the plate or not I would say
it's pretty
good I
mean it's not the best I've ever had but
it's definitely not the worse but the
sauce is good in it I really like the
sauce the Burger's good though it tastes
really good they give you a postcard
when they bring you the
check that's actually pretty cool let's
make sure they didn't charge us for that
postcard all right here's a look at the
check so you can see they did start the
the ticket at
737 so it took a long time they did not
charge us extra for splitting the plate
so that's great news and there is the
total price so that is an expensive meal
the tea oh yeah the oh the tea is very
expensive holy cow
$44.79 for
tea wow all right we are heading outside
to the freezing
cold
oh that wind is just whipping that was
our trip out to the Hamilton here in
Washington DC honest
review I would not come back what about
you I thought the food was good but it
was a really
long expensive yeah I mean what time is
it now it
is
8:40 and our reservation was for 7:00 I
think we got sh in seed around
6:55 and it's that late so that was a
big bummer um I do think the food tasted
really good they were running out of a
lot of stuff too they were out of the
steak
freets a pasta a pasta bread we got the
last bread they ran out of tea so that
was kind of a bummer now they were very
busy so we'll give them that but overall
I'm glad we ate here I just think that
there's probably other choices next time
that I would go to but at least you got
to see a review of what that is like um
we did share so it's probably going to
be a little cheaper than what it would
be if all of us got an entree but
overall that's a tour of the Hamilton
here in Washington DC with that being
said that does it for tonight thanks for
[Music]
watching hey
