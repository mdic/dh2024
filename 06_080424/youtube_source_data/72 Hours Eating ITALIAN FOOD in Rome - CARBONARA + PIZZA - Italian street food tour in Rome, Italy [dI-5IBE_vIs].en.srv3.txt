Buongiorno guys, it's Max Ginestra.
I can finally say it, I'm in Rome
Italy
precisely in Piazza del Popolo
I'm super excited
We have a three-day full of eating here in Rome
and I can't wait to share everything with you
Are you hungry?
Of course, you are
Andiamo!
For lunch, we came to a 90-year-old restaurant here in Rome
This is an institution here in Trastevere, a very historical neighborhood
Take a look at what we ordered
This is called "Carciofo alla Giudia"
which is a Jewish-style artichoke
which is fried and served with some salt, parsley and I think some olive oil
I haven't eaten this in 10 years probably
my grandma used to make this
Buon appetito
Mamma mia, so crispy!
The artichoke has this very unique taste
A bit salty, it's not greasy at all
This is a dish that dates back centuries probably
because we have a big Jewish Community
There is a Roman ghetto which is a Jewish neighborhood
that influenced our cuisine
and this is one of their dishes
As a main
Two Roman classics
Carbonara
Mamma mia, I haven't had Carbonara
in ages
This is one of my favorite dishes of all time
These are Tonnarelli
It's like thick spaghetti served with cured pork cheek, pecorino Romano cheese, pepper, and egg
And then
another very famous dish of Roman cuisine
Amatriciana from Amatrice
a small city close to Rome
The same type of pasta, Tonnarello
then we have tomato sauce, the same cured pork cheek, pepper, and pecorino Romano
This is illegal
I already can tell
I'm dreaming
I need to pinch myself
Am I dreaming or what?
No no, it's so good
You got the cheesiness, the fattiness,
it's a bit peppery, the egg yolk gives the creaminess
the pasta is perfectly cooked
Look at the fatty cured pork cheek
This tastes like childhood
Vai di Amatriciana
Huge chunks of guanciale
Oh, the tomato sauce
Sweet
Then you got that punch of the pecorino Romano
perfectly cooked, everything is still hot
and the fatty guanciale truly makes the difference
And as a dessert
of course
Tiramisu
freshly made Tiramisu
I think with Mascarpone cream and this is Gentilini, a traditional Roman biscuit
Mamma mia!
So elegant
Not too sweet
and the top is very soft then if you go down with your spoon it gets more solid
Amazing!
The best of the best
What an incredible place!
This is a place that no matter many times you come and visit gives you goosebumps all the time
It's incredible really, magical
And you can also get ice cream and enjoy it right in front of the Fontana
di Trevi
You have to take a picture, video throw the coin
I think your first time in Rome
so Rome is huge, very big
If you don't have enough time, there are at least three places that you must visit
One of these is Fontana di Trevi
Piazza di Spagna or Spanish steps and the Colosseum
after that, the rest is a bonus
All right
Let's make all a wish
Done
Rome is magical
Done
We came to probably one of the most
famous ice cream shops and pastry shops in Rome
This is very traditional, it's called Giolitti
This is a medium size cone
in terms of flavor, well there were so many options
I followed the guy's recommendation
We got dark chocolate, pistachio, hazelnut, and Panna on top, cream
All right, let's go for it
Oh, yeah! This is heaven
Not really sweet
We've been walking around Rome, the weather is beautiful, it's November
I still can't believe it's 20 degrees
It's fantastic
It's good to be back in Italy
I just wanted to show you
This beautiful Altare Della Patria which is in Piazza Venezia this is on the way to the Colosseum is one of my
favorite monuments in Rome
All right, andiamo
And now I've taken you to the most iconic place here in Rome
the one and only
The Colosseum
or as we call it
Er Colosseo
What a beautiful place
Now
I think I'm hungry
so we should go for maybe an aperitif
You can't miss an aperitif in front of the
Colosseum
For dinner, we came to have one of the most popular dishes here in Rome
Baccala'
This is battered salted cod
very simple but very traditional
And we came to probably the most popular restaurants in the city
which is still very old school full of classic Roman sentences or ways of saying
in dialect
Oh, so cool!
And these are Puntarelle
It's chicory family, these are the shoots
and they're dressed in a Roman way
with the anchovies
and also they told me to put vinegar and olive oil
And now it's time to go for it
They make them fresh at the back
Oh, wow!
Mamma mia!
So crunchy and crispy
Not greasy at all
so meaty
Not fishy
Oh, wow!
Can't get wrong with Baccala' in Roma
And let's try also the Punterelle
Oh, let's mix everything up
The smell of the anchovies
This is very unique to Rome
A bit salty because of the anchovies
a bit bitter because Puntarelle are a bit bitter
Crunchy
so refreshing
Oh, really nice
Every meal
in Italy
has to end with the dessert
and what we ordered is
homemade Crostata with ricotta and visciole
so this is a tart with ricotta
visciole are sour cherries
You taste the sweetness of the Ricotta
and then the sweet and sour punch of the visciole, of the sour cherries
I really miss my food
I really miss this food
I'm like a kid
I'm enjoying things like it's my first time again
Wow! It's fantastic
Buongiorno! This is day two from La Capitale
It's nine o'clock in the morning
and now
I'm going to show you the best way to start your day here in Rome
Andiamo!
For breakfast, we came to another iconic pasticceria or bar, coffee shop here in Rome
Regoli Pasticceria
This is a Roman classic
This is a crostatina,
so tart with small cherries and cream
Then Maritozzo con la Panna which is this soft bun with cream
This is a recipe in our cuisine that has been going on for centuries,
probably 3-4 centuries
It actually means "Not husband yet"
It used to be given, legend says, back in the day to girls to court them
And this is my father's favorite
Very soft bun with a kilo of cream on top
Oh, mamma mia!
The bun
absolutely soft
It's like a sweet brioche which is actually not too sweet
Mamma mia! This is a bomb
The last time I had it was
I don't know
10 years ago
And now
this gigantic tart
completely packed with ingredients
Sweet cherries, the tart is extraordinary
Crunchy, elegant, soft, that's why you want to wake up in the morning with
What a breakfast!
Oh, guys, if you want a real Maritozzo con la Panna
which is a must-try here in Rome, you have to come here
I'm a bit full,
I have to digest,
so let's walk
We have arrived in Campo de' Fiori which is probably my favorite part of the city
because at night time is very lively, you can enjoy an aperitif, a drink and stay out until late at night
During the day is very popular because there is a market
They sell local produce, clothes, and everything and of course, flowers
because Campo de' Fiori means flowers field
and is also full of very old little gems where you can get a proper
Roman snack
Oh, nice! Look at all the spices
See, this is what's very famous in our cuisine
Carciofo Romanesco
and Puntarelle
that we had yesterday
And Porcini mushrooms
especially now they are in season
and they're very very good
Ah, look at the cheese
Nice Parmigiano
Ah, look at the porchetta
Porchetta, Rosetta and Coppiettte
Typical Roman food
Right next to the market there is a famous local joint called Norcineria Viola opened since 1890
and take a look at what they serve
Salumi, cheese
Everything is local
Italian
Also from our region, Lazio
The smell is incredible
Almost overwhelming
Amazing
Let me introduce you
We have parmesan,
pecorino Romano cheese
a couple of other cheeses
These are called Puntarelle which is kind of a pork jerky
so dried pork
then we have prosciutto,
Lonza and four types of salami
Everything is accompanied by a local beer
and this is my favorite part
bread
prosciutto
and the spicy cheese
How much I miss this
Buon Appetito
Mamma mia!
We got the
thinly sliced prosciutto
that falls apart in your mouth
spicy cheese, fresh bread
Let's try Puntarelle
It should be a bit spicy, let's see
Oh, yes!
That's a bit spicy
Seasoned with a bit of fennel I believe,
chili, you can see it on top
Oh, really really nice! I missed this
Let's go for the salame as well
Oh, this is a classic
See, with pepper in it
Fatty
This tastes like childhood
Okay, let's go for the ultimate one
A couple of slices
My favorite is pecorino but I don't think suits perfectly this sandwich
Take a look!
This is a bit peppery and soft
Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano are hard cheeses
Peppery, fatty, it's got soft cheese.
So good!
I was looking around and I think what I ordered wasn't enough
This is a wild boar dry sausage
I'm kind of a nostalgic person
We used to own wild boars and pigs
and
yeah, my grandma used to make it and I really wanted to get one
It reminds me of her
So good!
Oh, wow!
This is a bomb
Really tender, fatty
You would think is dry
It's something like a jerky but it's not at all
It's not salty,
a bit peppery
it depends on how they make it
Really really good
Another classic
snack
well
It's up to you whether it's a snack or a meal
Panino con la porchetta
Sandwich with porchetta which is
a spit-roasted boneless pig
seasoned with fennel, rosemary, garlic, and also some pepper
I think this is Umbria style which is a region just up north, not really far from Rome
And I ordered a sandwich
Romanesco sandwich with artichokes, olive oil and onion *and pecorino romano cheese
Buon appetito
Mamma mia!
This is super mega illegal
This is spaziale
It takes you to the space
First of all the bread
fresh and crunchy
You can taste the fresh extra virgin olive oil
You got the porchetta which is soft,
tender, juicy,
fatty, super aromatic
This is worth the ticket to Rome for
And for dinner, we came to a very local restaurant close to Tiburtina station
which is a bit far from the city center
I came with my father before and I was very impressed by the food,
service, and ambiance
And look at what we have
This is my favorite entree, bruschette
This is a selection of different types of bruschette
We have a classic with olive oil and salt
Tomatoes
Prosciutto
This is olive pate
Cherry tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella
and I think this is
something spicy, maybe nduja which
is Calabrian spicy sausage
Let's start
For sure the first one needs to be this one
Buon Appetito
A bit salty, milky, sweet and sour
tomatoes,
crunchy bread,
olive oil on top
So fresh!
Now, it's time for this olive pate
Oooh!
A bit grainy almost
A bit bitter
olive oil on top
Usually in Italy when you order the selection of bruschette
you always have Olive Pate
Moving on
I don't know what's this
I think it's nduja
I like nduja, especially on pizza
Ma che te lo dico a fa'
That's what we say in Rome
Oh, yeah!
It's nduja
Oooh!
Spicy, a bit tomatoey
It's full of chili and tomatoes
When you put this one on Pizza
You will be on fire
And as mains
Of course, we had two plates of pasta
These are linguine allo Scoglio
with mixed seafood, cherry tomatoes, garlic, white wine, parsley
I'm mouthwatering while I'm describing it
Also, handmade gnocchi actually gnocchetti, small gnocchi
potatoes gnocchi of course
with Gorgonzola cheese which is a blue cheese
and spicy nduja which is the one we had the bruschetta with before, the spicy one
All right
Let's try the fish first which is a bit you know lighter and less aggressive
in flavor
Let's get calamari as well
Buon appetito
Oh, wow!
Look at mussels
Mamma mia!
Oh, so creamy!
Pasta al dente
It's got that nice touch of cherry tomato and garlic
Fresh seafood
right from the sea
Oh my God!
This is heaven on Earth
And it's time to try gnocchi
Okay
A bit spicy because of the nduja
See, this is the nduja
It's pretty spicy
Very creamy because of the cheesy gorgonzola cream
The cheese is not too strong
I expected a stronger taste
While in Rome, you absolutely have to have gnocchi
I haven't been back in almost nine years
and you know
walking around the city
It's like enjoying and appreciating the city and the food as well the way I should have done before leaving Italy
Because sometimes to appreciate certain things
or to understand
certain things
You don't have to have them for a bit
I hope you get what I mean
I'm really loving it
It's like I'm falling in love again with my country
Third day here in Rome
I mean, we couldn't leave the city without
the famous
Pizza al Taglio
Mamma mia!
Bonci Pizzeria
Very close to the Vatican
They're in documentaries and stuff
also probably the most expensive pizza I've ever had
but
I'm sure it's good
Take a look
This is spicy salame with goat cheese cream and tomato base
This is with the prosciutto, mozzarella, I believe mushrooms and tomato base
This is with pumpkin, potatoes and sausage
This is with pancetta which is a cured pork belly, egg and potatoes
One more thing, I forgot to mention
I've also ordered the classic Roman Suppli' which is breaded rice with tomato base and mozzarella in it
I like the tomato base, it's a bit sweet
Crunchy, nice mozzarella
Soft rice, almost a bit al dente
Can't get wrong with Suppli'
Alright
it's time for the pizza
I have to start with this one
I've been recommended by one of the guys there
Pumpkin, sausage, rosemary, rocket
Buon appetito
Mamma miaaa!
Perfect base
Crunchy!
The pumpkin is so creamy, sweet
You got that fattiness and savoriness of the sausage
I never tried a combination like this before
Now
This one
with pancetta, egg
And look at the pancetta, the fat,
parsley on top, egg
It's all about the pancetta
Peppery, fatty, salty
The egg gives that creaminess and just a touch of very thinly sliced potato
And now it's time for one of my favorites
The one with prosciutto
This is an Italian classic
You can't get wrong with prosciutto on top of the margarita
I'm dancing, I'm dreaming
Mild mozzarella, thinly sliced prosciutto
Prosciutto is my favorite cured meat of all time
A bit of bitterness from the rocket
The dough
Ma che te lo dico a fa'
Super crunchy
This is the winner, I already know
and now the last one
Spicy salami, tomato base,
parsley,
one potato in the middle by mistake, and goat cheese cream
Buon Appetito
I love the goat cheese
The cream is a bit airy
it's like whipped cream but a bit savory
After trying them all, they're amazing
What makes a difference
ingredients
but I think the dough is the number one thing
My favorite has to be the one with prosciutto
It's a very popular place
We went there 30 minutes before
they opened
There were people lining up
The place got really crowded from tourists and locals
It's a bit expensive but I think you have to try it while in Rome
That's a suggestion
We're ending our video in another country
in Vatican
We are in the beautiful piazza San Pietro in front of the Basilica
They're doing some renovation,
they're preparing actually
for tomorrow morning's service held by the pope himself
People are lining up to get into the Basilica
just to visit it
It's one-kilometer long queue
It's beautiful, we enjoyed our time a lot
and I just wanted to ask Sherly
What was her favorite food here in Rome
in this trip
Did you enjoy your first time here in Rome?
This is my first time and I enjoyed it so much
Rome is such a beautiful city
What was your favorite food?
That's hard to choose but I would say the seafood pasta
That was good
And also the pizza that we had
Oh, yeah!
Today it was really really really good
The pizza this morning was insane
Okay, Max, tell me what was your favourite food
It's hard to choose
I've had really nice food in the past three days
But I have to go for
the Amatriciana that we were at the first day
That was illegal
And the pizza that we've had today
It was on another level
Anyway, we need to end our video
Hope you guys enjoyed it
because we enjoyed walking around the city and eating and showing everything to you
Let us know in the comment section down below which one was your favorite food in this video
and what we need to say babe
Ciao ciao!
Ciao guys! See you next
Sunday :)
