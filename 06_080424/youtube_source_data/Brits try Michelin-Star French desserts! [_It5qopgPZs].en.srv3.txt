Hi, I'm Josh.
I'm Ollie.
We've just had some of the best French food in existence.
And we're about to try French classic desserts.
Hello guys!
Hello.
At this stage, Thibaut, you could feed us anything.
You could bring a brick from the street and put it in front of me, I would eat it.
It's okay.
We trust you.
We believe you.
Okay, rice pudding with hazelnut caramelise, vanilla and orange zest.
Wow!
We have rice pudding in England.
You eat it in school and prison.
It's very basic food.
It's comfort food.
It doesn't look like this.
This looks a lot better.
It's so good for me.
Holy crap.
Ho. Ly. Crap.
What?!
That is SO good.
This is the best rice pudding I've ever had.
Oh, it's incomparable.
Gabie, Luke and Andy, get a spoon each.
You need to get involved.
Oh my gosh. Every day.
Wow.
Oh man, the crunch from the hazelnut as well.
It's incredible.
It is genuinely a joke.
What?
That’s unbelievable!
Oh my gosh!
I had rice pudding every week.
In prison?
It's unbelievable.
It's perfect.
It's my dessert from my grandma in France.
Did your grandma used to make it like this?
Yes.
Wow.
Wow.
Try another dessert?
Please, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I want to have a little bit more.
We'll finish this.
The next is a bit tasty.
One kilometre of...
I mean, it's a foot long éclair.
Oh, it's really dense.
Oh my goodness.
There's chocolate on the inside as well.
Wow.
Cheers, mate.
Wow.
This is going to be a quiet video.
This is absurd.
This is absurd.
It is SO good.
It's like if you took Nutella and made it lighter and more chocolatey,
But you couldn't eat Nutella in this quantity.
You'd get sick.
I could finish that.
I could eat all of that by myself.
Andy’s got a sweet tooth.
This is his favourite video I think we've ever filmed.
It's ridiculous.
It's actually ridiculous.
It's incredible.
It is actually ridiculous.
Yeah.
Take one for the team.
He's just invited us to the kitchen.
Apparently, there’s something he wants to show us.
Crêpes Suzette.
Sugar straight in the pan.
Little bit caramelised.
After, orange juice.
Wow, look at that.
Oh, that smells so good!
It smells like toffee apples.
Yeah, yeah.
Never seen that before.
Butter, of course.
Garlic?
No garlic?
No.
No garlic.
Okay, garlic for savoury.
Give me the snakes, please.
The snakes?
Crepes are just soaking up the orange.
And caramelise.
Whoa!
Oh my gosh!
Oh, there's a lot of alcohol in there.
Yeah, it's hot.
Guys.
Oh, it's finished.
Wow.
Look at that.
Cheers, mate.
Wow.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, wow.
What are we doing with our lives?
It's like a crêpe that tastes like a very unhealthy smoothie.
You know?
Like it's very sugary, very fruity.
And a little bit alcoholic.
You can taste it, it's like kind of Christmassy.
Oh, yeah.
I just got a very alcoholic bit.
Alcohol in there, soaked into there.
Before next...
It's something we can actually drink?
Yes.
Yes.
Alright...
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
I love that.
Science!
I absolutely love that.
What does it smell like?
I mean, it smells like a dessert wine.
Oh, it smells amazing.
So I think he said this is supposed to help everything go down.
That is so good.
Profiteroles.
Ohhhh!
Oh dear.
Oh dear.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
Hot chocolate.
And is it ice cream inside?
Ice cream.
Vanilla ice cream.
Ooh, look at that!
Both!
Both?
I simultaneously was getting brain freeze.
My teeth were freezing and I was drowning in chocolate sauce.
I couldn't breathe for a second.
The water feels warm by comparison.
Yeah, of course.
I'm in heaven.
I'm somewhere between heaven and hell.
Andy you can't just drink it from the jug.
Mate, don't let them see you doing that.
You can't just drink it.
Are you serious?
Is it still hot?
Open your mouth so we can see.
No, it's a really nice temperature.
Smile for us.
Give us a grin.
That was the best thing I've ever done in my life.
Oh, this is big.
Chocolate mousse. My signature dessert.
This is chocolate with hazelnuts, a little bit.
Mmm!
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
Oh Luke.
That's one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.
No.
Wow.
Wow.
Chef.
This is unbelievable.
Look at this.
Wow.
I feel like I'm living in a fantasy movie and I absolutely love it.
I've never been this happy.
This is getting ridiculous now.
That's genuinely the best cocktail I've ever had.
Genuinely.
Like 100%.
I feel like I'm on the best possible honeymoon with you right now.
It's incredible.
It's incredible.
I'm in love.
It is the city of love.
With the food obviously, but also with you because you brought me here.
It's hard to communicate quite how good this is.
We've tried food from all over the world.
But this is really special.
Thibault, thanks to you.
All is finished.
Oh, we want more.
I have, if you want.
This has been so special.
Thank you so much, Thibault.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Every time in Paris, you're welcome.
Oh, we'll be here every time we come back.
Do you want to come in and finish the video together?
Yes.
See you JOLLY soon!
Merci beaucoup!
Thank you so much.
We are trying to find the best crêpes in Paris.
This looks absolutely incredible.
Well, there's definitely no miscellaneous pig in there.
