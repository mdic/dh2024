guys it was such a beautiful day today I
didn't want to be stuck in the kitchen
inside so I'm brought the kitchen
outside and we're going to cook
spaghetti marinara spaghetti marinara is
a pasta is a seafood pasta made with
fresh local seafood and I'm going to use
the mussels just to give you that really
nice sea flavor you're gonna love it so
let's hit it first let's boil some water
for this I'm using a whole chili split
in half scrape the seeds chop finely set
it aside some flat leaf parsley it's
been washed chopped finely
set aside
once water boils add some salt
cook your pasta almost al dente
I've got some beautiful fresh scallops
add them in half width wise if they're
really small just skip this step
with the muscles you want to make sure
they've been cleaned just scrub them and
remove any beards okay let's start
cooking some olive oil
and you want high heat
some prawns or shrimps
you want to see them nicely on each side
that's where all the flavor is
no need to cook them right through just
yet Now set them aside as Seafood Cooks
at different rates
some anchovies
place them on a cutting board and give
them a rough chop
back with the same pan on high heat you
may need a little more olive oil
add the capers
the chopped chili and the chopped
anchovies
some garlic minced or chopped
mix it up and leave it until it starts
to Brown
then quickly deglaze with white wine
add some marinara sauce it's a tomato
sauce you can buy it or see my recipe
how to make it now mix that up
add the muscles give them a mix and cook
for three minutes with the lid on
return the prawns and add the scallops
[Music]
add the chopped parsley Now drain and
add your spaghetti straight to the sauce
cook for another 30 seconds
mix well
spaghetti marinara is ready
[Music]
[Music]
oh yum
