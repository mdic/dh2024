So, Joe, today we're going to visit
some British Indian curry houses.
There is a distinction there
because these probably aren't going to be
the most traditional Indian meals
that you've ever had in your life,
but they are specifically
British Indian cuisine.
The way that we've identified these
is places that have chicken
tikka masala on the menu.
Have you had that before?
Joe: I think so, yeah.
Harry: Although I think
there is some debate
as to whether or not it's
a British Indian dish
or whether or not some
places do serve it in India
and it's just become really popular here.
Man, you British.
Can you guys just stop colonizing
for, like, five minutes?
Let them have a thing!
OK, well, regardless, I'm
really stoked to get it.
I am so jet-lagged.
I'm, like, this close to crying.
So I feel like some Indian
food would really hit the spot.
Yeah, this could be an
emotional day for you.
So, we're here at Tayyabs.
This is an East London institution.
It's been here for years. People love it.
Celebrities come here.
Jon Favreau absolutely loves this place,
came here with Pedro Pascal. Love him.
The standard things that
we're going to order today,
like I said, probably
the chicken tikka masala,
and then probably a naan as well.
We might slightly mix up
the filling of the naan
or the topping of the naan,
but I think those two are a good baseline.
Does that sound good?
Joe: Yeah, great.
They're kind of famous
for their lamb chops here.
They do a really good
grilled, spiced lamb chop,
so I think we should get some of those.
You know they're good when
the picture made the menu.
Harry: Yes.
Joe: Right?
That sounds good. It's not too much food,
but I think we should pace ourselves.
I've learned the hard way
that we should pace ourselves.
Oh, I know. That's your problem, pal.
Harry: These are the papadams.
Have you had these before?
Joe: Probably. Yeah, probably. Yeah, yeah.
You get these, and they always
come with a range of dips.
And we're just, I'm just taking one?
Yeah, you can kind of go for whatever.
Some people just karate
chop the whole thing.
Joe: Did you want to do that for ... ?
I mean, did you want to do
that, as our guest of honor?
Joe: Sure. Ready?
Harry: Just go for it.
Joe: Yah!
Wait. But now it's all ...
And then you just have nice
little bits that you can
kind of pick and dip.
And these will probably
come out immediately
because they've just
always got a stack of them
ready to go in the kitchen.
They'll bring these out,
you have a few of these,
then the rest of the food
kind of starts to come out.
So we've got a few dips here.
This one, mango chutney.
Getting any mango flavors from that?
I am getting mango flavors,
and that is so good.
Yeah, this is probably my favorite one.
Joe: Wow.
Harry: Yeah.
It will vary slightly
depending on the curry house,
but normally, you're
getting a mango chutney;
a yogurt, cream-based sauce,
like a raita of some kind;
and then usually a spicy option as well.
Haven't actually tried that one yet.
How spicy are we looking?
Not very spicy, but enough spice
to let you know it's there.
Harry: Uh-huh.
Joe: Right?
I love this. This is
always the one where, like,
if you came for a family
meal and you had a curry,
your parents would be
shouting at you at this point
to not fill up on papadams.
I was about to say, slow down.
This is like in America
when you get Mexican food,
after you order, chips
and salsa at the table.
Nice. We don't really get that here, but
I see how that would be
equally as dangerous as this.
Because you're waiting
and you're socializing,
and you're just hitting
it. Next thing you know,
your food shows up and you're
like, I'm not hungry anymore.
So, like, obviously, you guys have
Indian food in the US.
Joe: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But am I right in
thinking it's just, like,
culturally not as significant
and not as much of a big deal?
I think it's, no, I think
it's pretty popular.
I mean, I understand the India culture
here in Great Britain,
probably more evidence
over the century or so versus in America.
But, hey, America's a melting pot, baby.
We got everyone. We got
everyone and we got everything.
Ooh, here we go.
Joe: Yes, sir.
Harry: Thank you.
Oh, yes, all right.
Joe: I'm losing my mind.
I'm instinctually grabbing my head
because I feel like
it's going to spin off.
This looks, oh, my God.
It's pretty good, right?
Joe: Oh, my God. This looks so good.
Harry: I think the rest is on its way.
Joe: Yeah, they're bringing it in. Yeah.
Thank you.
Harry: Thank you.
Joe: Awesome, fantastic.
Harry: Thanks very much.
I have to say, everything here
looks absolutely incredible.
I am so excited.
Harry: Me too, honestly.
Joe: Oh, wow.
I'm just excited to eat.
Should we just dive in?
Joe: Yeah.
Harry: OK, cool.
I feel like, grab yourself a lamb chop.
Yes, sir.
Harry: Hear that sizzle.
Oh, my goodness. And is that
a bed of grilled onions?
Juicy. Yeah. Looks amazing.
A lot of people will refer
to it as "naan bread."
Joe: Uh-huh.
Harry: That's actually just
like saying "bread" twice,
because naan is just kind
of an Indian word for bread.
Joe: Do you want me to do the
chicken tikka masala first?
Harry: I feel like it's up to you, man.
Go crazy. I think that's
a nice place to start
our curry journey today.
Joe: I mean, this is,
it's what we're here for. We're
doing this at every place,
so let me try it. Here we go.
Mm.
What are you getting there, Joe?
Well, it's delicious.
Harry: Mm-hmm.
Joe: I love the flavors.
Good start.
Joe: You really taste
how the meat is grilled.
Sauce is incredible.
What are some of the distinct
flavors here that I'm getting?
Harry: It will vary slightly
depending on the restaurant you're in.
Generally speaking, they'll
start with a masala,
which is kind of the way
that you actually refer
to a blend of spices. Some common ones,
ginger, cardamom,
coriander in there as well.
Joe: Flavor-wise, profile
is absolutely incredible.
No notes on that.
Harry: No.
Joe: Very good.
I'm going to try some of this
lamb. It just looks beautiful.
These are some juicy lamb chops.
Joe: Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
Oh-ho. It's so juicy.
Joe: OK, so the spice on this
pairs with the lamb perfectly, right?
Harry: Mm-hmm.
The flavor's just jumping
out at me right away.
It's enough spice to know that it's there,
but it really accents the
flavor of the meat perfectly.
It pairs with it incredibly,
so I don't feel like I'm
eating a piece of meat
that was just covered in a spice.
No. You can tell this has been marinated.
Yeah.
It's been cooked in the
sauce, just like you said.
They're not just, like,
cooking them separately
and then kind of combining
them at the last second.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That flavor is in there.
You might also see some variation with
the type of chicken
that's in there as well.
We're generally talking
chicken breast pieces.
But I think this is good
because you get quite
big pieces of chicken.
So they've stayed really tender
in the cooking process
as well, really juicy.
It's not really about the heat
with a chicken tikka masala.
This is something that was kind of adapted
for the British palate,
so not super spicy.
But in terms of the
richness of the flavor,
it's really, really tasty.
That's what I'm talking about, richness.
Quite tomatoey.
Do you get the tomato
coming through from that?
Joe: I absolutely do.
This, to me, I just want
to, like, take the chicken
and the rice and the naan,
put it all together, boom.
That's kind of the joy of
eating at an Indian restaurant.
Yeah.
You can kind of just
mix whatever you want.
Often, if you come with a big group,
you'd all get a few dishes,
and you just kind of share them around,
try lots of different things.
If the camera wasn't here, I
would lick this bone clean.
The sauce is just, mm.
The camera's here, and I
am licking the bone clean,
so go crazy.
I'm not going to.
I don't want that footage on the internet.
So, they don't eat a ton
of lamb in the US, right?
It's not super common.
Lamb doesn't seem to be as
popular of a meat in the US
as it is here, certainly, but
I think that's something to do
with the fact that the US, like, clearly,
we're just like, cattle,
beef, pork, beef, beef, pork.
Like, the two animals we're really just
pushing on the population
for at least 200 years.
There certainly is lamb.
It's just not as popular, yeah.
Interesting. I will say,
these are some of the best
lamb chops I've ever had.
These are fantastic.
Joe: Yeah.
Harry: So, we took you to
Tayyabs because it's kind of like
a elevated British Indian
experience, I would say.
It's a pretty standard
British Indian curry house
in the terms of, like, the decor.
It's a little bit kitschy.
They have some familiar
things on the menu,
like the tikka masala. But
I think, yeah, like I say,
this is kind of an elevated
version of a tikka masala.
The place we're going to go
to next I think will give you
a much more authentic
British Indian experience,
particularly when it comes to the masala.
I think the color might surprise you.
The flavors might surprise you a bit.
It's going to be interesting.
All right. This was fantastic,
but how authentic is it?
I don't know if you've
noticed this about me, Joe,
but I'm actually not from
India, so I can't really talk
to the authenticity of
the food and the cuisine.
I can maybe talk to the experience
of a British curry house,
but not that part.
I have invited a friend along
who's going to meet us at the next place
who I think will be able to
explain a little bit more
about what British Indian
cuisine actually is,
how it compares to actual Indian cuisine,
and we'll kind of go from there.
Joe: Sounds great.
Harry: I've known Qayyah for many years.
We've been at Insider together for, what,
like, five years now?
It's been over five years for me.
We're kind of old.
Yeah, we started out, started
on the same desk together,
have kind of gone separate ways,
and now rejoined again on the
video team, which is great.
You might have had her voice
on "So Expensive" videos.
That's how I know you.
And there's also, I don't
think, anyone more qualified,
at least that I know,
to talk about the
authenticity of Indian food,
definitely more so than I am.
Qayyah: Well, I grew up in Liverpool,
but my mom immigrated from
Karachi when she was quite small.
I think she might have been about 1.
And her mom was from Uttar Pradesh,
which means that she's UPite.
And Dad was from Sindh.
So Sindhi and UPite.
And because I've got
that background there,
obviously, we grew up at home
kind of cooking a lot of food,
making a lot of rotis on
the tava all the time.
We cooked food at home
ourselves quite a lot.
And we did also go out
for lots of "Indians,"
which is quite a British phenomenon.
Like, it's a very, it's very important.
But in my mind, that's quite separate
to sort of the food that we had at home.
So I'll see how the
food stands up, I guess.
I think two metrics are important here.
So I'm going to be measuring this against
different chicken tikka masalas
that I've had elsewhere,
but I'm also going to be measuring this
against my mom's butter
chicken, or chicken makhana,
which, I'm going to say that
it's kind of "more authentic."
Joe: OK.
So we'll see.
Great.
I mean, if this beats your mom's curry,
I feel like that could be a problem.
She's going to see this video.
I know she's in the comments.
She's definitely a "Food Tours" head, so.
Harry: Of course.
Qayyah: I'm scared!
Joe: Be careful what you say!
So, you may be wondering
why we're at this restaurant specifically.
Very much so.
There's a few reasons for it.
Obviously, Brick Lane and
curry, iconic in London.
Like, this is the place
where you will probably go.
If you just Google, like,
"London curry houses,"
this is kind of where
it's going to send you.
It's very iconic. There's so many of them.
There's, like, 23 or 24 restaurants
just on this one stretch
of road, which is a lot.
But this one consistently just
dominates in the rankings.
People have rated this really highly.
It's very up there on Tripadvisor.
I think it's the
15th-best-rated restaurant
in the whole of London on Tripadvisor.
Not just curry houses, just
restaurants in general.
Fantastic.
Harry: All those people
can't be wrong, right?
That's correct. I totally agree.
They should've that in the
window, though. Do they?
Maybe they do.
I think they generally
tend to put pictures
of the celebrities who've visited.
Joe: I have noticed that, so thank you.
One thing, so I live in Los Angeles,
and what's really popular
there, they do this as well.
But another thing they'll do is,
because everyone in Los
Angeles is a performer,
is that they'll give
them a signed headshot.
Nice.
Which makes sense. But then
when you go into restaurants,
it'll be plastered with framed headshots,
and you're like, "I don't know
who any of these people are."
Yeah, so.
It could be a good way to, like,
try and get a discount on your bill
and be like, "I'm actually kind of famous.
Here's my headshot."
Joe: Here's the headshot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You just, you fold that
into the little tab book,
like, there you go.
Do the handshake where
you, like, slide it in.
It's this big picture, like —
It's in the —
"Hey, can I get a table near the window?"
Guy's like, "What are you doing?"
A4-size picture.
It's 8 ½-by-11-inch.
All right.
I'm actually really
curious to try this because
I don't know that I've
ever tried vindaloo before.
Harry: No?
Joe: Oh, really?
Harry: Look at the color
on that. That's beautiful.
That is bright!
Joe: Wow.
Qayyah: Wow!
Joe: Thank you.
Qayyah: Wow, wow, wow!
Harry: Mm-hmm.
Ketchup. Did we order ketchup?
Yeah, but this is —
That's so much ketchup.
Joe: Very generous with the ketchup.
This is exactly like my mom
makes it, by the way. Exactly.
Joe: With the ketchup?
Yeah! Exactly like this!
Harry: Thank you. We have a small feast.
Qayyah: I'm really curious about this.
That's almost like it
might be radioactive.
Like, it's very bright.
I don't think I've seen
a chicken tikka masala
this bright before.
Harry: Have you not? I feel like I have.
Qayyah: No.
Harry: See, we went to Tayyabs
and we had the chicken tikka masala,
and it was much more like this color.
Qayyah: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's, like, a normal ...
I'm going to try it.
Yeah. We all are. I'm very excited.
See, now, this is actually
quite a traditional thing,
to have little bits of
colored rice as well.
We often do, like, rainbow rice at home,
which was always a novelty thing.
That was my favorite
track on "Mario Kart."
Should we start dishing
up? Joe, do you want to?
Grab yourself some rice.
In my mind, tikka masala is this color.
To be fair, this is, I
mean, if you think about
an authentic British Indian curry,
if is supposedly like a British take
on an Indian, traditionally
South Asian foodstuff,
it makes sense that
it's that color, right?
I think "traditional" is —
"authentic" is doing a lot
of heavy lifting there.
Joe: Would you like some rice?
Yes, I would. Thank you very much.
But it's very, it's always tasty.
Are you going to do it with the naan?
I'm going to go for a
little bit of a naan scoop.
It smells nice.
Cheers, gang.
Yeah, cheers.
Mm-hmm.
Joe: This one is sweeter
than the last one.
Mm-hmm.
And much more creamy, right?
Yeah, a lot creamier.
The chicken is cooked well.
It is cooked well. Very tender.
It's not chewy, which, I get really angry
when people give me curry and
it's, like, chewy chicken,
and that's not OK.
It's almost impressive to
make chewy chicken in a sauce
where you've been simmering it, right?
Qayyah: It's happened.
It's happened to me.
The one we had at Tayyabs
definitely had some heat to it.
It wasn't spicy. But I think
I was taken aback by that,
because this is, again,
more what I'm used to
from a classic British curry house.
This kind of hits on the
classic you were expecting?
Pretty much. There's almost no heat to it.
It's very sweet. It's very creamy.
Joe: It's fantastic, though.
I am very impressed with the flavor.
Over here, we have?
Harry: So, this is the lamb vindaloo.
It's got an interesting story, vindaloo.
It's, like, come from
several different cultures.
There's, like, Portuguese in there.
Then it's kind of gone
from Portugal over to India
and then back to the UK.
And every time, it's kind of
changed what it actually is.
Interesting.
In the UK, if you order a
vindaloo, it's basically, like,
one of the spiciest curries
that a curry house will offer.
Joe: OK.
I've ordered this one with lamb.
This is the spicy guy.
This is the spicy guy.
This might be the thing that wakes me up.
Harry: It may be.
Qayyah: I've never tried
this before because I —
Why not?
I just wouldn't. Like,
it's not really something
that I would — is there potato in it?
I mean, it is aloo in the
name, right, I suppose.
OK, OK, I'm getting the spice.
I'm getting that tingle.
Is it only a tingle?
Yeah, it's not overwhelming spice.
Oh, another swallow,
and I'm kind of feeling
it build up on my lips.
You got to watch out
for those chilies, man.
They creep up on you.
Joe: This has a decent spice to it,
but, ooh, the flavor's just mwah.
The lamb, cooked perfectly.
I feel like for me, I'm
not feeling anything.
But there is flavor there,
which is really nice.
I'd probably have a
little bit more seasoning,
but ah, I'm not, you know.
If we had to nitpick.
Eh.
As mentioned before,
Qayyah's made me cry with chilies before,
and I'm not crying from
that. It's very tasty though.
Like you say, I do think
it's a nice balance of, like,
yeah, that warmth, the richness.
That lamb. The lamb's so good, man.
It, like, falls apart in your mouth.
So, I noticed that none of us
have been tempted by the chips yet.
I will just say, this is very
much not authentic cuisine.
Yeah, I did want to say chips,
fries, as we call them in the States,
do not normally come with Indian cuisine.
No. And I'm not sure
when they started coming
with British Indian cuisine. I do think
it's very more the British
side of British Indian.
But I think it's one
of those things, again,
where sort of, like, immigrant populations
would open a restaurant,
and if there's demand there,
which, in Britain, there
often is demand for chips,
you're just going to serve
it. Like, you're missing out
on free money and free
customers if you're not.
And therefore, chips are put on the menu.
I do think, like, they go well with stuff.
I mean, what I will do
is get a couple of chips,
dunk it straight in that masala sauce.
Can I also just weigh in
and say these are more like,
these look to me more like french fries
than they do traditional British chips.
Hm.
Like, a chunky chip is what
I associate with British.
Is this what I'm doing here,
then? You got the sauce on?
Harry: Go for it.
And also, like, we do this at home.
I'm British Pakistani Indian.
Like, there's a whole mix going on there.
Chicken and chips, man, it's a thing.
It's really good. It's really good.
I do think that's a good idea
to have the chips, fries,
to finish off the sauce,
because one thing I've noticed
in my many years of eating Indian food
is that you eat the protein or the veggie
that's whatever's in the sauce,
and you usually have,
like, a lot of sauce left.
And that's just kind of
what you grow to expect
having Indian food.
So to have something for
cleanup is a pretty smart idea.
Yeah. One of the founding
brothers of Tayyabs
says that when he goes out,
he will order chips with
his Indian food, so.
Joe: All right.
Harry: Yeah.
It's not just a British thing.
Sounds legit.
And what do we have here?
So, this is a bhaji,
and it's kind of like a
battered-onion thing going on.
I don't really like breaking them up
because I just tend to
eat them all to myself,
but I'm going to split it up.
Harry: Annoyingly, they've
given us two between three,
so just get stuck in. That's fine.
You have a whole one
because you're our guest.
They smell good too.
Mm, crispy.
Mm! That's really good. That's fantastic.
Harry: Mm-hmm.
Qayyah: Mm-hmm.
Harry: I love ordering
these when I go out.
These are an excellent starter.
These are a mainstay in my curry order.
Joe: Sure.
That's a good one. It was
very crispy, not overly oily.
Mm-mm.
This was fantastic. I loved everything.
I think the chips thing is growing on me.
Again, I'm probably be more
of a clean up with the naan
than the chips, but I
think it's a pretty good,
an inventive idea that I do stand behind.
And then, Qayyah, final note from you.
How does this kind of compare
to a home-cooked Indian meal?
Is it better? Is it worse?
Is it just different?
I do still put them in two
completely different ballparks
because they're just not
the same thing for me.
And it's still a really nice
thing to go out for an Indian,
but for me, like, it
just tastes so different
to my mom's cooking.
Qayyah, thank you for joining us.
I hope you had a nice time.
Please take some leftovers
because I'm not going to want
any more curry after today.
Qayyah: Perfect. Thank you very much.
So, what do you want to do next?
I've probably got room for,
like, two more curries.
Yeah, I can go for two more curries.
Harry: All right, cool,
that sounds good. Let's go.
So, this is Punjab Indian Restaurant.
They've been here since the '40s.
They used to be, actually,
before they were in East London,
and then they moved here
actually to be closer
to the Indian embassy,
which is really cool, because
the staff at the Indian embassy
missed some traditional dishes from India.
And they moved here to be closer to that,
to supply that demand.
So you know it's going
to be authentic here.
Yes.
And from what I've heard, very tasty,
although I've not been here before.
Oh, well, I'm very excited.
Everything on the menu looks amazing.
I love the vibe in here too.
Harry: Mm-hmm.
Joe: Really digging it, so.
Harry: Yeah, I love the
historical feel to it.
Pictures on the wall.
They're pretty proud of the heritage here.
So, we're two in, about to do three.
What are you expecting from this one
that's different from the
other two we've been to?
I think with this one,
we should pay especially close
attention to the flavors,
because one thing that I don't think
we've actually talked about much yet
is that oftentimes with
curry houses in the UK,
they will all start their
curries from the same base.
So you'll get, basically, their masala,
which is like their blend of spices.
They'll kind of create
that, and then every curry
is built upwards from
that same foundation.
Joe: Oh, OK.
Harry: So I want to see if
those flavor differences
really shine through with, like,
a couple of the different
options that we've got today.
Joe: Yeah. Ooh, I can't wait.
Something's sizzling.
Something's sizzling
on its way over to us.
Harry and Joe: OK.
Whoo!
Yo.
Harry: Jesus, man.
I mean, that's just great fun.
That was fun, yeah.
Harry: Thank you so much.
Talk about a dish to get
everyone's attention.
Harry: There we go.
Yeah, we thought the
previous sizzle was good.
Joe: Yeah. Wow, wow, wow.
Man, look at that!
So, this isn't the masala.
This is just the chicken tikka.
So you got these pieces of
meat, usually put on a skewer,
and then grilled over an open flame.
So it lends itself
to this really lovely charred
flavor on the outside.
And you've got a mint sauce
and a yogurt, I think.
Joe: Mm, really succulent.
Fantastic cook to that.
Harry: Mm.
Nice little show with them
setting it on fire too.
I mean, you know.
People in America love dinner and a show.
Kind of our version of dinner and a show.
Yeah, that heat knocked
me out of my jet lag
for about 30 seconds.
And it's just settled back in.
So, what we have here, samosas.
You have had these before, right?
Joe: Yes, I have had a samosa before.
Harry: Yeah, these are fantastic.
Joe: Yeah.
Harry: A real staple.
These are very spherical, as
far as the ones I'm used to.
Sometimes you see them
as quite a flat triangle.
No, these are usually the
ones that I get in America.
Yeah, the place I go to
in LA has them like this.
Harry: I was going to cut them,
but, like, what am I thinking?
Oh, wow.
Harry: With the sauce.
Joe: I love these so much.
Harry: Mm!
These are definitely a go-to.
Harry: Oh, man.
Whoa.
Harry: Mm-hmm.
Joe: The pastry, the crust, so savory.
Fantastic, wow.
This is another thing that's,
like, it's easy to mess up.
It's kind of like,
similarly to the bhaji, when
you fry something like this,
it's kind of a risk
that you'll just make it
really oily and gross.
But you're getting none of that here.
Just extremely, like,
flaky, crispy pastry.
That filling's really good.
I don't know what that sauce is,
but that was lovely as
well. It's sweet and smoky.
Server: Chicken tikka masala.
Joe: Thank you, sir.
Harry: Lovely, thank you.
Joe: Ooh, yeah, all right.
Harry: OK, start with the
classic, the tikka masala.
Initial impressions, not as, ah —
Joe: It's not as vibrant as the last one.
Not as luminous.
But I want to say also,
the first one, again, was more like this.
Harry: It was darker, yeah.
It's really interesting to see,
yeah, I guess what small
changes they're making
that are kind of causing
quite a big difference in the end product.
Joe: Oh, man.
That is fantastic.
Harry: That might be
the strongest reaction
we've had today.
Yeah, this sauce.
Ooh, wow.
Right? Right?
Harry: Mm.
Joe: What is it about this one
that stands out from the last two?
I feel like it's, the sauce
is, like, bonded more to it.
Like, it's thicker and creamier.
Although the last one
was pretty creamy too.
This one, I mean, the sauce,
the flavor of the sauce is remarkable.
Harry: There's a richness to it
that I don't think we've had before.
It's that concentrated flavor.
Joe: Yeah. Ooh, wow.
I love it so much.
Harry: I get, like,
intense tomato flavor
as well from that one.
Yeah, there is a richness to this one
that we have not had in the previous two.
Not saying the previous
two weren't also very good,
but this one, as far as, like,
first bites are concerned,
that's the first one I've been like, yo.
Yeah, that was the strongest reaction
I've seen from you all day.
What are you doing?
Harry: I'm just giving you some rice.
OK, thanks.
Harry: I'm trying to —
Joe: What about today made you think
I can't rice my own plate?
Harry: I'm trying to be a gracious host.
Joe: All right.
Harry: I did just want to point out
the description on the
menu of the garlic naan,
which says that, "If you
have any erotic activities
planned for after you leave us,
perhaps you should resist
the sensational garlic naan."
I don't know if it's erotic,
but after this, I'm meeting
up with Dracula, so.
Yeah, I mean, maybe steer clear.
You don't want to give
him some kind of reaction.
Blah.
That's my whole Dracula impression.
Blah.
Harry: Has Dracula ever
said "blah" in the books?
Like I've read a Dracula book.
I'm more going about the
Dracula from "Looney Tunes."
Harry: Oh, OK, not Bram Stoker.
Blah!
You know what? Maybe you
don't pick up on this here,
but in, [laughs] in America —
Go on.
I have noticed a lot of
Americans would probably think
Dracula is from Great Britain.
OK.
Oi, mate, let me suck your blood.
I think it works.
What's all this then?
When Van Helsing shows up,
"What's all this then?"
We've gone wildly off task.
Oh.
So, Indian food.
Joe: Yeah.
This is fantastic.
Oh, I haven't even tried the naan yet.
Harry: That is garlicky.
They're not lying.
I mean, if you actually look at it,
I wasn't sure what these were,
but I think this is, like,
strips of grated garlic
just straight on there.
Joe: Wow.
They're not playing with the garlic here.
Harry: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Vampire-free zone.
Yeah, forget about churches.
If vampires are chasing, then go in here.
I do like the amount of garlic on here.
It's very garlicky.
I think maybe the texture,
it's on the thinner side.
A bit more thin and crispy
than we've had at some
of the other places.
A lot of the time, when I think of naan,
it's a bit more pillowy and thick.
Yeah. Well, I feel like
I'm hitting my limit.
I have room for maybe one more curry.
That's great because we
have one more curry to eat.
Joe: Fantastic.
Harry: Ready for that?
Let's do it.
Just think of the sleep
you're going to have
at the end of this.
It will be restorative.
Harry: It'll make it all worthwhile.
All right. Let's do it. Let's go.
All right, hey.
To another great day.
Cheers, my man.
I don't believe I've had this before.
This is mango lassi.
This is another sort of
classic South Asian drink.
Give it a try and see what you think.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I was about to ask what's
the difference between this
and a smoothie, but, it's great.
This is actually fantastic.
It's really good. It's very thick.
It's a yogurt-based drink.
This one has mango kind
of blended into it.
It's funny, I was thinking
on the way over here, like,
I'm really thirsty.
And nothing quenches my thirst
quite like anything the
consistency of gravy.
The thickest liquid imaginable.
I'm just imagining, like,
finishing a marathon
and them handing me this, like, no!
Slightly better.
Look, we did a "Food Wars" and
we talked about thick water,
and you loved thick water.
This is just kind of
like that but with fruit.
I will say, if anyone has
a problem swallowing pills,
this is it.
Harry: Take one of these.
So, Joe, here we are at
our last spot of the day.
We are at Spice Village. We're in Tooting.
Have you been to Tooting before?
No!
What kind of question is that?
Have you been to Tooting before?
I have been to Tooting.
My brother actually lives
kind of around here.
I haven't been to this
restaurant before, though.
OK.
Harry: So, now we're in South London.
We started off in East London.
I think between maybe East,
South, and maybe Southall
and some areas kind of
like northwest London,
those are the areas where
you're probably going to find
some of the best South
Asian food in London.
So this is kind of completing
the tour in that regard.
Joe: Fantastic.
Compared to some of the other
places we've been today,
this place is slightly more modern.
They only opened, I think,
after the year 2000.
Been here about 20 years,
but in that time have
established a real foothold
in the kind of South London curry game.
They are known for
doing a very good curry,
which is, of course, why
we've brought you here.
They were shortlisted at
the British Curry Awards
this year.
Joe: The BCAs?
Harry: The BCAs.
Joe: Wow.
Highlight of the calendar year
for many people in the UK.
They're taken seriously.
Like, politicians go.
When you purchase your yearly calendar,
you flip right to it, like,
got to make sure I don't accidentally ...
get right to the, yeah.
And the curry-themed calendar as well.
So you flip it over and
you're, like, figuring out
which curry you have for that month.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You flip to March and you're like,
"Oh, I can't wait to eat that one.
Ooh, it looks good."
Hey, we're kind of joking around,
but, like, if I still had a
paper calendar hanging up,
still had a use for it,
a curry-themed one would be really great.
Harry: Yeah, curries of London.
Curries of London calendar?
I will purchase that one.
We should make that.
I think, we've been pitching
merch for a while now.
I think "Food Tours" merch,
that could be the first place to start.
Joe: I'm rallying for this curry.
Harry: Can you make one more?
Joe: Yes, I can.
Harry: OK, cool, we'll do that.
Joe: OK. I have to say,
this looks incredible.
Harry: The food looks very tasty.
You get to serve yourself.
Last time, you didn't like it
when I served you food, so.
Joe: It's not that I don't
want you to serve me food.
It's just, it came out of
nowhere. It was weird, all right?
Is this going to become
a thing between us?
I mean, the way you said
that was very pointed.
Look, I was trying to do a nice thing,
and it just felt like it
got thrown back at me,
but that's fine.
We're going to be bickering
like an old married couple
by the end of this.
Can I get the check, please?
All right, I'm loving how this looks.
Harry: OK, man.
Joe: And go.
Cheers, man.
Dude.
Dude.
Whoa.
That's really good.
OK, we're hitting some areas there.
I'm just going to free-associate.
Harry: Spitball, go on.
Joe: Heat, spice.
Perfect level.
I'm feeling the heat.
Nothing I can't handle.
Let me know it's there,
enough to really keep the tingle going
as you savor the rest of
the flavor in your mouth.
Speaking of flavor,
fantastic on this. Savory.
Again, thick enough
to where you're really getting
the flavor of the sauce,
but not too thick where it's, like, pasty.
It's not thin enough
to where you feel like
it's running around everywhere.
Harry: Mm-hmm.
Joe: Dude.
I think you're right. You've
hit on the sort of, like,
the mouthfeel that you get there,
the viscosity of that sauce.
It really coats your whole mouth.
Like, I'm still, just one bite,
and I'm still holding on to the flavor.
And the spice, it's not
so much like, "Ow, hot."
It's like a numbness
that just is soothing.
It's almost like my mouth is
relaxed, if that makes sense?
Yeah, I feel that's taken us
on a bit of a journey there.
I bit into it, and I was, like, buttery.
Like, smooth.
Joe: Yeah, whoa.
Heat starts to rise.
You get the tomato. You get the spices.
That's fantastic.
I'm going to try it
with a bit of the naan.
Oh, yeah. Get a dip.
Mm.
The naan's really good too!
Harry: Mm-hmm. It's that
thin style of naan again,
which I think is actually
maybe a bit more authentic
than the kind of thick, fluffy ones.
Joe: Oh, is that right?
Harry: Yeah.
Joe: I adore that.
That was very good. OK, pakoras?
Yeah, so these are pakoras.
Joe: No, I've had pakoras before.
Harry: You have?
Joe: Oh, yeah.
I haven't seen pakoras shaped like this.
They're usually more of a lump.
Yeah, I'm used to these
more in bhaji type of form,
but I like this.
I feel like you get a lot
more exposure to the oil,
and therefore, they'll get crispier.
This might be the best
pakora I've ever had,
and I love my pakoras.
Here we go.
OK.
Wow.
I feel like the spice level of this dish
is higher than probably any
of the other tikka masalas
we've had today, right? Not in a bad way.
The spicier one, but I
wanted to make it clear,
it wasn't too spicy or overwhelming spicy.
Enough heat to remind you where it's from.
The heat is almost like,
I could bring it. I'm choosing not to.
Harry: Yeah.
Just flexing on you a little bit, eh?
Yeah, just like, "Don't
forget where you're from.
What's up, taste buds?"
Tikka masala, part of the
reason why we've tried it,
I think, is because it's
such a good reflection
of the curry house
because there's no two
recipes that are the same.
Everyone does it slightly differently.
Even here, they have two recipes.
We got the creamy one,
or you can just get
kind of the normal one.
But I thought the creamy
one would be nice.
Yeah, well, you're out of your mind
if you're getting one different from that.
I mean, I guess I would
try the normal one,
but there's no way they have
a better version of that.
But, I mean, all the
versions we've tried today,
no two have been the same, have they?
They've all been completely different.
I just think that's really interesting.
And again, I think it's a nice way
to measure the quality of a place
just as a baseline, kind
of building from there.
Didn't Qayyah say that, like,
Indian food will differ family to family?
Yeah.
Joe: So it's interesting
that per Indian restaurant,
it could be completely different.
Yeah. I think there's no, like,
right or wrong way to do it.
Obviously, it will come
down to personal preference.
But yeah, it's just really fascinating
to see those little changes in the gravy,
in the masala being so strongly reflected
in the final product.
They've all been delicious.
I think we've got a decision to make.
Yes, we do. So, first of all,
thank you for taking me
to all these great places.
You're so welcome.
If these four are any indication
of the Indian food that
you can get in this city,
in this country, wow,
you guys are so lucky.
What I loved about it is I
thought every place did it
basically how they wanted
to do it. You know?
So, Tayyabs I do have a soft spot for.
I've been there before. Love it there.
The lamb chops were fantastic.
Joe: Oh, yeah, those lamb chops.
Harry: Those lamb chops were excellent.
Joe: This ain't a lamb chop video, though.
Not a lamb chop video.
But those lamb chops, world
famous, rightfully so.
Harry: True. I think Brick Lane was good.
It was educational, I think, for you.
Joe: Yes.
Maybe not in terms of
quality or taste the best,
but I will always have a soft spot
for the British curry house experience.
Joe: Yeah, and the chips
there, that was fun.
Harry: Yeah, the little
thing of ketchup. Fantastic.
Joe: Yeah, they gave us
a lot of ketchup, yeah.
That was a lot of ketchup.
OK.
And then between, I think,
Punjab and Spice Village,
what we've seen really is
a more elevated experience.
I think the flavors on display
here have been wonderful.
And for me, I think it kind of
comes down to these last two.
But I want to hear what
you think first, Joe.
So, it was down to these
last two, but for me,
this was the best one.
Harry: This was the best.
Joe: I'm just jumping to it
because I'm saying, like,
everything about this was fantastic.
The spice, the texture, the mouthfeel.
The chicken was cooked perfectly.
And these pakoras are
the best I've ever had.
I know we're also talking about the naan.
This might also be my favorite naan.
Harry: Interesting.
Joe: Yeah.
So for me, this is the best one.
What do you think?
I do think this might have just nicked it.
This was one of them.
Although I don't think
it's as big a margin
as you might think.
Oh, really?
Just pipped it to the post. But, I mean,
the flavor of that is just unbelievable.
Yeah, so I think we're in agreement.
This is the best food
we've ever eaten, ever.
Wave the little Spice Village flag.
This also has the distinction
of being the first "Food Tours" we've done
where I kind of want to steal the cutlery.
Sorry you can't see it, because,
I mean, when their
branding their own cutlery,
you know they're doing something right.
Golden cutlery for a gold-star restaurant.
This looks like if I knew
how to throw a knife,
I could just, like,
flick! Right at the wall.
Anyway, yeah, this place is fantastic.
Worth coming down.
The first, the only
reason to come to Tooting.
You're the first American
to step foot in Tooting.
First of many, I hope.
Yeah, and the last.
When I go back, they're
like, "How was it?"
I'm just like, "Tooting, skip it."
Harry: That's fine.
Joe: Skip it.
Yeah, just gatekeep Tooting.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right. The end.
Harry: Boom.
