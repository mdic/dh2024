rulers settling in Naples to rule the
city so imagine Kings princes everyone

to pass through the gate and that's a
Marble Arch it's an amazing City and
just the history the architecture how
things are just modern daily life is
just surrounded by ancient architecture
and
history oh okay and that's Nao football
team
yes so here we go we're starting at one
of the most legendary bakeries in the
city what exactly is a
babaa is a something very delicious it's
a a kind of Brios invented by a Polish
GMA oh better say was a zar in Exile was
San
linski and um he was in Exile in France
at that time French France was ruled by
Maria antonetta the one who was Beed the
queen and Louis 16 and as the queen of
France and the queen of Naples were two
sisters everything
invented in Naples and having a certain
success was imitated also here in and
the bab arrived here and it's a kind of
Brios which must raise three times it's
very difficult to be made at home after
baking they soak it in the room which is
not only rum I say homeopathic quantity
of rum together with water and sugar
they soak it they squeeze it and the ba
is
ready back to the depths of the kitchen
to see more of the Baba
process oh
and he's the fourth generation of his
family wow okay okay so Baba is
something with so much cultural
significance in uh in Naples and it's a
cake but it's really bubbly and Airy and
you smell the aroma of the rum and
there's different shapes and sizes and
even like different sculptures of Baba
and it has so much cultural meaning and
significance and it's really a huge part
of the culture though it's only fitting
that that's what we're starting with the
Baba 500 Baba per day oh and here it is
in the in the oven
baking many different
sizes
shapes all of these are
Baba
[Music]
see so this is more rum or syrup no no
this is the rum this is the rum with
syrup with the syrup and sugar okay okay
they have some seeding here on the
outside oh yes this is it's such a cool
place it's a Heritage and old school
Bakery very locally popular and again
they're famous for the Baba all
different shapes and sizes with such a
cool history we got the classic just a
personal sized which kind of looks like
a giant mushroom and you can smell that
Aroma as soon as you order it it's
already been soaked in the sugar syrup
water and then rung out but then once
you order he just showers it gives it
another drenching in that sugar syrup
water with rum and the
aroma smells so good all right bonao so
you just kind of dig in wherever or do
you maybe the proof is that it must cry
cry so who it's really fluffy and spongy
all that syrup look at that texture in
there by
[Music]
mhm all the flavor of the rum
mhm that is so
good it's so fluffy and spongy it's so
fluffy and spongy but it's also so
delicate you don't perceive
the uh
the big quantity of rum it's like you
can really taste the flavor of the rum
but it's not that strong of R but the
the flavor is there the sweetness is
there it's so juicy and wet exact that's
what makes it so good so juicy and
wet really nice not a huge cake lover
but this is really good because it's
like a a beverage at the same time as
you have a cake and it goes down really
well because it's so so
fluffy and that Baba's perfect with
coffee you need
coffee yes I mean napoi is known for
coffee as well

to try
ciao let's start here spaghetti with uh
bongol uh these are shells actually okay
and they must be eaten uh very quickly
because otherwise they start being fresh
um they start being sticky spaghetti is
you know it's an Institute is
O spaghetti oh man the Tomato Sal I'm
going to try to twirl some some of that
spaghetti and get oh there got one of
those clams yeah all
right
oh
wow
Bishi man the flavor of the clams the
flavor of the octopus broth the the
tomato sauce in there all coming
together coating every spaghetti it's so
good the spaghetto is crunchy yes it's
not sof like Americans
toook alente
perfectly it's notal American I'm joing
of course but normally outside from
Italy but this is the way I like to eat
this is how I like to eat pasta how I
like to eat spaghetti chewy you really
feel the texture of it it doesn't get
mushy on you it perfectly absorbs all
that sauce and all that
flavor that is stunning and then you can
just nipp on the little the little clams
that like they're tasty but I think it's
the essence of the flavor of all those
clams that just embeds within the
spaghetti that makes it so good this is
a mix of seafood with the c bonga
octopus and
canoli this is a typical type of shells
you find here in Naples and it's a I
think in English a razor can you see the
small sh are not bong they are called
lupini oh oh octopus there's razor clams
in here yeah and then the Tomatoes the
olives in here and one of the things
that he did which I loved so much is
that he when he finished it then he
sprinkled on he drizzled on chili oil oh
this is another
just just beautiful spaghetti okay try
that spaghetti first before trying that
octopus
so that's this this is a good
moment oh
wow the Tomato the chili oil The Parsley
again the octopus broth that mix of
seafood the just completely released
into the the spaghetti okay and now we
got to try that octopus let me just bite
it octopus is so
tender so meaty that's one of the
greatest ples of spaghetti I've ever had

table oh I love this place little
chili oh there we
go oh I mean all of this I mean they're
all spectacular we still have one more
to try one more pasta to try but that
spaghetti with the mix of seafood I
think is the the winner for me with that
chili oil
m wow you get an olive it and that gives
you that extra Savory like pickled Briny
taste in your mouth to go with that that
seafood and all those flavors oh this is
really really something
spectacular
okay let's try the next pasta this is
called lailana it means the Sicilian
pasta oh okay ah because it was it is a

the world's most important famous
beloved foods and it originates right
here in
Naples here we
are
[Music]
wow you can't come to Naples without
eating pizza neapolitan pizza the the
original we are at Lombardi which dates
back to
1892 this is an old school Pizzeria and
I mean as the pizza Story Goes uh pizza
was I mean they've been making baking
flatbreads in this region of Italy for
so long for for centuries and they would
sell it from the back of a bicycle and
often even carry it on top of their
heads but then within Naples uh they
finally opened the first pizzeria indoor
Pizzeria so the pizzeria date back into
Naples are originally from napl
and the Margarita Pizza Buffalo
mozarella and San Marano San Marano the
San Marzano Tomatoes go on parano
parano
extra oh
basil oh this one is with
salami
he is so fast at making pizzas the dough
is really gently kneaded and then on
goes your variety of toppings and I love
that stretch move onto the paddle
directly into the oven it takes no
longer than about a minute and a half 90
seconds for the pizza to cook and he
just like monitors it so closely till
the dough bubbles up that crust bubbles
up perfectly uh chars on the edges and
on the bottom and then he just does that
that twirling rotation move just to make
sure it's all even and that also ensures
that the crust Dr out evenly on the
bottom Roman Pizza doesn't exist that is
for
catcha not because there is so no Roman
Pizza neapolitan pizza neapolitan pizza
napl pizza the pizza was born in Naples
Naples here the pizza here the concept
of Pizzeria so a place where you could
gather with your friends SE and have a
pizza is ancestor so the first
generation is the first one not only of
his family but in general who brought
the pizza in us oh really really in
1933 LOM New York oh and that's why it's
called Lombardi and then in New York
Jano Lombardi ah and in New York there's
very famous Legendary Pizza lombardis
originates from it's from your family
wow same family so same family basically
a lot of the pizza in the United States
I mean it comes from Neapolitan Naples
has its Origins here and Roots right
here oh that's incredible the amount of
influence that this restaurant that the
pizza has had is almost unparalleled
Mark do you know frii oh yes this the
type of like a broccoli from Naples frii

Sal okay we're getting the the double
size the super sized
pizza oh it has a special
paddle

oven it's going to bake for about a
minute possibly 90 seconds as it's a
larger size oh that's going to be
amazing all fresh ingredients all
natural ingredients the San Marzano
tomato sauce oh man what a place I love
the energy the action oh it's huge here
we go what a pizza oh man amazing are
you ready M okay ready
Alberto the name to be given to this
pizza is Margarita just like the name of
the Queen of the queen
it takes up the whole plate yes okay
here we go so the margarita and oh man
the Buffalo mozzarella the aroma of the
basil the fresh olive oil the San
Marzano tomatoes look at that puffy the
crust is Puffy and
charred and yet just Saucy and juicy on
the inside oh that's a massive
plate-sized piece of pizza wow I got to
take this to the mouth
fast
oh
wow oh
man oh that is so
good it's almost like soupy in the
center it's so juicy from those Tomatoes
The juicy saltiness of the mozzarella
the aroma of the
basil wow slightly chewy the dough the
crush is slightly chewy perfect Char on
the bottom Smoky from the fire
oh that's
Perfection and in the
center it's the dough the the crust is
really nice and thin and then as you go
higher and higher to the crust gets more
and more puffy more bubbly slightly has
a nice little
chewi I really love that fire smoke um
yeah that perfect Char that gives it so
much flavor that's a spectacular
Pizza the original neopolitan Margarita
I just love those big slices of Buffalo
mozzarella they're just it doesn't
really fully melt so you just got these
big lumps of mozzarella that tastes so
good I don't
know it's a true Harmony uh Perfection
of ingredient combination Al together
baked un flatbread oh okay okay graan
okay now I want to taste the difference
because we got half of the Buffalo
mozzarella which is the from the Buffalo
and then half with the cow mozzarella so
there's two that's a big distinction and
they even slice it differently it acts
differently let's try this whoa oh yeah
sometimes you can almost do the I think
it's called the envelope fold where you
fold it in because it's so juicy fold it
in and then you you fold
[Music]
again
M oh man okay both cheeses are delicious
the mozzarella is more of that
fresh milky Buffalo taste um and it I
think it melts less than the cow
mozzarella the cow mozzarella I think it
melts a little more I mean they're both
good you just got to try half and
half oh yeah
happiness in
Naples thank you very much amazing so on
