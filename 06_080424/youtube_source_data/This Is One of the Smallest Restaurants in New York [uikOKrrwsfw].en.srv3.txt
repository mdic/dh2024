nestled in between the skin care love
beauty spa and advani's Pest Control
School here in Elmhurst Queens is indo
Java a two-ile mini mart for all things
Indonesian but every Tuesday it turns
into the city's smallest restaurant with
truly authentic Indonesian food
you're in luck you got the best table in
the house
it's also the only table

I'm the owner of the Indo Java
we open in the Java 10 years ago
every Tuesday I cook right here for all
the customers
we call Warren's Lassa so it's meant
Tuesday food stall this little supret
turned one table pop-up restaurant isn't
complete without one of the smallest
kitchens in the world our kitchen is
very tiny it's a love kitchen because
just enough for two person
two people might be a stretch it's half
the size of a broom closet but it
doesn't stop daily from whipping up
classic Indonesian fare like gudeg and
rendang I am
[Music]
just like the original
me
before there is none Indonesian store
it's difficult to find the ingredient
from Indonesia and we miss the community
if we have a store the Indonesian people
will come here and then we still can
chop Indonesian language
that's our our dream and then now it's
happened
[Music]
I'm not a professional chef I don't have
any the education share background so I
just learned from my mom in the
restaurant the chef always hide in the
kitchen I like talk with the customer
when I serve the food so that weekend
sharing the story they always say it
next week I have to come again
foreign
