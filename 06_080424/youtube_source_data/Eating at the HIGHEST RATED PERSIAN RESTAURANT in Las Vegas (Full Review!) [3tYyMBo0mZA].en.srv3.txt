tenderloin we call it beef bag
yeah yeah we slice it very skinny very
skinny bad means leaf yes it has to be
skinny as a leaf
okay yeah the flames are amazingly hot
yeah the flames are just attacking this
meat from the bottom so you really have

the chef is monitoring it making sure
that all the chicken and beef and the
veggies are all cooked properly for this
extraordinary iranian food experience
oh yeah look at that that's the bread
chef ben is gonna put it right in there
you spraying some water on it yeah okay
there you go we're ready to go inside
oh there it is it's cooking in there
when i said that this is an epic persian
food feast i really mean it in front of
me i got like 9 10 different items all
the way from the dips to the salads to
the meats and the breads this is truly a
fantastic middle eastern dining
experience that you can have here in las
vegas i'm so excited let me see some of
the things that i got here for today
so beginning with the salad and the
various dips this one is what's called
the masto
pierre i hope i'm pronouncing that
correctly masto kier which is fresh
yogurt mixed with cucumbers mint and
house seasoning and notice it comes with
some fresh veggies okay this is what's
called grape leaves very traditional
well-known
persian food and i like the way that
they plate it up with the cucumber as
well that looks so interesting and some
walnuts and this is the hummus i think a
lot of people know about hummus
especially if they eat middle eastern
food that's pureed garbanzo beans sesame
tahini fresh lemon juice garlic and
olive oil yes
beautiful little shirazi salad it comes
from a city
called shiraz in iran so yes it is a
specialty
salad that's mixed with a lot of
different ingredients just chopped
cucumbers onions
tomatoes tossed in dried mints and
dressed with lemon-based dressing oh man
look at this one so this is called the
casho parmenchan i hope i pronounced
that right it's basically their mashed
sauteed eggplant blended with the kash
as well as topped with caramelized
onions fried garlic and mint this is
really the fanciest grape leaves i've
ever had
the way they designed it
what is this like some sort of there's
like rice inside i think
and then a whole bunch of grape leaves
that are wrapped around it's a little
bit sour that's the way it's supposed to
taste
but it's really one of the most awesome
persian appetizers you can have in a
restaurant
off to a good start so far
oh man
that is one creamy almost that looks so
delicious
[Music]
that hummus is fire
it's so creamy so rich so delicious so
with the yogurt you take the pita bread
you dip it in and you've got to get a
lot of it that's how you make it taste
so so good
that yogurt is so creamy
very creamy
has that strong uh kind of like a milk
taste to it it's good though i've had
this many times
this suraj salad is so cute look at this
little
earthen bowl that it comes in
just a little salt pepper olive oil
some lemon juice i think
it's very healthy too
this one looks so delicious i heard it's
a special recipe that tastes unlike any
others
[Music]
that is so good
no kidding
okay so the eggplant
is fried it's mashed that's what it
tastes like in your mouth so rich but
what's really good is this fried
mint that's on top of it
this piece of bread right here you see
that
it's kind of like a pizza kind of thing
and i'm going to tear me off
a piece of that
and use it as a dip
that bread is so fluffy
it's almost kind of like eating uh
like a pizza dough in some ways
like a neapolitan pizza dough but a
little bit more of that
that pita texture to it
it's a really good bread
man you can just eat it by itself when
it tastes so good i'm telling you eat it
by itself or eat it with the dips this
one or the hummus
wow this this rice looks amazing so chef
what do we got here okay we got here the
basmati rice uh with the saffron already
that you see the yellow part and the
burberry that's one of the favorite
mix and toppings on a
rice that we are using on a dishes so
colorful so tasty
a little bit sour and you're gonna love
it
we got here lamb chops okay that we call
it shishlik in
iranian dishes uh we have the
chicken kebabs or chicken tender that we
use for this purpose we have lamb fish
inside the chunk pieces of the lamb and
i have a beef
beef fish
uh is inside also
on the left side if you come in here yes
we have the ground beef uh they call it
kobe de one of the most popular kebabs
beef kebabs and persian dishes
on the top we have the chicken wings
that we not fry at we just barbecued
drumsticks and wings
so delicious already marinated
everything like one or two days before
so the rice is really one of the
highlights of persian cuisine you have
rice in a lot of different
middle eastern and of course asian
countries but let me tell you nobody
makes rice quite like
iran persian rice is just so good
because it's delicious it's colorful and
then if you get like for example
barberry rice it's sweet it's like
fruity that's why i'm going to get a
generous amount of this rice and really
enjoy this rice as part of the meal not
just as a filler but really enjoy it
like it's a crucial part of the meal
should i start off with the kubernetes
the ground beef
it's cooked perfectly all around
if you guys have never had a kubernete
before
you're missing out that's the first
thing you should order when you go to a
persian iranian restaurant is the
kubernete
it's the best ground beef that you can
have seriously
oh
i wish i could get up on this table and
just dance around that's how happy i am
right now now guys are so amazing
basmati rice is so delicious
and here they put the barberry fruits on
top of it so it tastes almost kind of
like
cranberries or raspberries or something
like that on top of it it's very fruity
the best fruity rice that you can taste
i didn't really think that that would
have been a good combination but it is a
fabulous combination okay so the next
one i'm going to eat are the lamb chops
this one i'm very excited to try they
said it's the best seller here you must
get it
yeah yeah
oh yeah that is like lamb chops to the
best
see i like this lamb chop because it is
so it tastes really like something that
came out of your backyard barbecue and
the meat is so tender not tough not
gamey
really some of the best lamb that you
can eat
oh yeah it's really good
it's so tender and it's kind of crispy
on the top too
with that smoky taste
you gotta get the lime jobs here it's so
good oh man
and then i'm also gonna try what's
called the barg they call this the leaf
the leaf beef i think because it's so
thin
that one it's so good taste
it's just like steak like a skirt steak
basically
squirt steak yeah
like a
carne asada
by the way did i mention that this
platter comes with a lot of veggies like
tomatoes
and mushrooms
bell pepper and all that really healthy
stuff actually
let me go with like a chicken wing that
looks pretty good right
now that is very tender
and very juicy very flavorful
everything that i've had here was just
fantastic
definitely you need to come with a big
group if you're going to eat all this
food no kidding man
all right ending it off with some ice
cream this is their
baklava ice cream that's bottom is the
baklava the top is a saffron ice cream
very characteristic of persian ice cream
yes gonna give me a nice
scoop
of this ice cream this is the first time
i've had ice cream and baklava it's so
interesting now that i think about it
oh dude i'm so glad i got this
this is so amazing
so the birds the ice cream itself
saffron ice cream
it's so delicious already
saffron flavor it got some pistachio
nuts crushed all over it but then if you
mix it with the sweetness the crispiness
the honey taste of the baklava in the
bottom
it is like a winning combination
this is also a thing you cannot miss out
on this restaurant i mean the rice is
really good the barberry rice saffron
always such a favorite of mine and the
eggplant dip is mind-blowing truly a
unique recipe
that's just so so good as well as the
bread
and then the meats but you know what i
did not expect
is the saffron ice cream with the
baklava i didn't even think the two
could work together and this is the only
restaurant i've been to by far that
makes this combination saffron ice cream
with the baklava and it is mind-blowing
i would say come here
just for this yes get get everything
else as well of course and finish it off
with this ice cream anyways yeah so if
