Home to over 9 million people Mexico City is 
the largest populated city in north America and  
when it comes to food they know how to throw it 
down but can this city also master a vegan scene  
I'm Eunice and i'm going to show you 
where to eat iconic vegan Mexican dishes  
their stories and what sites 
you need to see let's go!
If there's one taco you must eat 
in Mexico city it's the al pastor  
because it's everywhere but if you're 
vegan there's no need to have fomo  
so why is this taco so iconic in the 1930s 
a wave of Lebanese immigrants arrived to  
Mexico and introduced shawarma meat cooked 
on a rotating spit by the 1960s Mexican-born  
children of these immigrants began opening their 
own restaurants and combined their heritage  
with a Mexican twist hence the al pastor taco was 
born so what's the story behind the restaurant
every day the vegan al pastor is made of wheat 
gluten and marinated for 24 hours then it's  
hand-picked to form the perfect shape on the spit 
the iconic pineapple is then placed on the spit as  
the base for the meat to be formed and cut and 
grilled for the perfect juicy crisp then it's,  
of course, served with locally made tortillas 
garnished and topped with the iconic pineapple,  
okay and now it's time for the best part to 
try the al pastor tacos that they are known for  
I have been eyeing this thing just from seeing it 
on the spit oh my gosh it looks absolutely amazing  
i topped it off with the guacamole salsa 
it's guacamole so it's the spiciest one  
that they have here at the restaurant they 
served you with beans on the side it's just  
I love that they put the double tortilla so it's 
like a really good filling meal all right cheers
I love that the meat is like really juicy inside  
and has that nice char on the outside the color 
is beautiful it's due to that adobo sauce that  
they put on top if you're a meat-lover 
I challenge you to try this it's so good
it's the perfect spice level has 
great flavor it doesn't feel dry  
it feels meaty it hits that spot for that craving 
that you want especially if you're in Mexico city  
you want el pastor tacos come on like that's what 
they're known for here so you don't have to miss  
out you get to enjoy in that as well I love that 
the pineapple gives that touch of sweetness the  
lemon that you put on top is great you have to 
get this but wait there's more Por Siempre Vegana  
offers an extensive menu and another of their 
stars is the molcajete a dish where the specialty  
is grilled vegan meat grilled cactus aka nopal, 
chiles serrano, onion and of course avocado.  
Once the meat is perfectly grilled it's placed in 
the hot molcajete topped with salsa grilled onions  
serrano chilies crispy melted cheese and 
avocado and now you're ready to feast
this is a specialty dish that's 
common here in Mexico city as well  
this is an experience and of course 
they serve it to you with hot tortillas  
so I'm gonna dig in oh my word 
i don't even know where to start  
when they were grilling this meat it looked so 
real i was like i could fool anyone with this
oh my word I just want everything 
look how beautiful this avocado looks  
oh this is more of like a build 
your own taco type of thing  
I'm just gonna dip it all in this 
salsa I'm dying here all right cheers
you guys I haven't had grilled meat like this like 
carne asada in a long time this straight up gives  
me the fix brings back memories this is amazing 
like highly recommend you have to try this bring  
a friend feast enjoy their whole menu they offer 
so many other things they have bread desserts  
breakfast you name it they got it 
to have the street food experience  
good economical delicious you gotta do it
the next day was gonna be an adventure so i 
started with a fresh green juice by the many  
local fruit stands that you can find and 
then stop by Vegamo for a popular seasonal  
bread called pan de muerto since i was traveling 
during the days approaching the day of the dead  
this sweet fluffy bread is 
traditionally far from vegan but  
so many vegan restaurants were 
offering them I couldn't resist
but the real treat was visiting Xochimilco a 
tourist attraction that you cannot miss so if  
you're going to Mexico City it's 100 worth it 
to make the trip to sochimilco it's about a 40  
minute drive outside of the city but it's a really 
inexpensive uber drive it's about 10 us dollars  
the reason you have to come here is because 
as soon as you get here it's a canal with  
all these beautiful colored boats and it is an 
experience and a half you get here you can hire  
your own private mariachis they make you food 
on the go like as you're on the canal these  
little boats that have tacos and everything making 
stuff if you're vegan your only option is squash  
blossom flour that's what i have but they serve 
it to you with the sliced nopales of the cactus  
so that was really good to have it was delicious 
it seemed simple but it was amazing and then of  
course the roasted corn with salt and lime 
it's amazing definitely recommend to do it  
the next morning it was time to try the best 
iconic treat in mexico churros okay it's not  
a complete trip to mexico without churros now 
mexican churros tend to have egg in them and are  
sometimes made with butter so oftentimes people 
think they're not available vegan but here in  
mexico city there's a chain called el moro that 
is popular amongst all people non-vegans as well  
because they make vegan churros and you can have 
them in a bunch of different ways and they even  
have a vegan hot chocolate that they make without 
milk it's chocolate konawa so chocolate with water  
and it's spiced and oh my goodness everything 
they do here is absolutely delicious they make  
thousands of churros a day people line up out 
the doors at night is when it gets really busy  
locals come in here and enjoy like you seriously 
cannot pass this up they offer different kinds  
like just with cinnamon and sugar or just 
plain sugar i of course got cinnamon and sugar  
because that's the best way to go that's the 
perfect combination so i'm gonna try this
this is absolutely delicious so the churros are a 
Spanish influence here that's where it comes from  
and it's interesting because the spanish churros 
are made with oil, water and flour there's no egg  
so you can tell that they kind 
of adopted that recipe here  
and they kind of have put their own spin on 
it with the cinnamon and sugar to make it more  
mexican style and it's just it has that perfect 
chew still because that's the thing with mexican  
churros is they have a good chew to it this 
has the perfect crisp and chew and cinnamon  
and sugar and it's delicious the chocolate's 
amazing you just have to come here before  
heading to my lunch spot i decided to walk 
through one of the largest city parks in  
the western hemisphere el bosque de chapultepec 
think of it as the central park of mexico city
but of course it was time to 
eat again so i headed straight  
toward gatorta for vegan street food at its finest  
okay so another thing you have to try when you're 
in mexico are tortas for those of you who don't  
know tortas are basically giant sandwiches 
i've gotten their most popular option which  
is milanesa with salchica which is thin meat 
and hot dogs and it comes with beans and avocado  
cheese salsa grilled onions pickles like 
vegan mayo you name it they wrap it in  
plastic for you because not only is it to 
go it gets messy so let's give this a try ah
oh my god
this is definitely super meaty again the milanesa 
is like a thin breaded meat they make everything  
in house except for the hot dog if you want 
a torta experience this is where you got to  
come check it out because they have a bunch of 
different other things like al pastor etc about 30  
of their customers are non-vegan and they 
really enjoy it so it just goes to show  
how much an advancement they're making here 
in mexico city so if you want to try virgin  
tortas you gotta come here and check it 
out i'm just gonna keep feasting on this
and because there's one on almost every 
block i had to go to la michoacana paleta  
shop for a coconut palette aka a coconut 
popsicle made with water and not milk  
but this was so creamy and straight 
coconut that you wouldn't have never known
there's no better way to burn off your lunch than 
some shopping so i had to check out the ciudadella  
market a traditional style mexican market that 
specializes in the sale of mexican handcrafts  
and folk art the market is the first of its kind 
in the country and was established just before the  
1968 summer olympics to promote mexico's cultural 
heritage and it's home to over 350 vendors
on that note it was time to finish my night at one 
of mexico city's most instagrammable restaurants  
so i've just arrived to La Pitahaya mexico 
city's most instagramable vegan spot  
because they are known for their pink 
tortillas so you can just imagine the  
beautiful photos that come out of 
that so i came here to check it out  
because i couldn't resist because i 
want to see if it's worth the height
so why are the pink tortillas 
so iconic what's the story  
so it's actually a funny story of why these pink 
tortillas started so the owner one day bought a  
pack of masa to make tortillas and beet juice and 
on his way home it spilled all over the muslin and  
made it pink but he's like whatever i'm gonna 
make tortillas anyways and voila this was born  
and it's made it all over the gram i got their 
green enchiladas with the famous pink tortillas  
and i gotta say this looks amazing so far visually 
it's already kind of reaching up the hype i got  
the extra chickpea chorizo it looks straight 
up like chorizo i can't believe it's actually  
made out of garbanzo beans but all right enough 
said let's give this a try they make the tortillas  
to order so they have an open kitchen and 
you can just see them preparing the order  
which is kind of nice oh this green salsa looks 
absolutely amazing all right let's check it out
okay it lives up to the height the filling 
of the enchiladas are hibiscus flour jamaica  
and mushrooms and they chop it up finely 
so it resembles like that meaty texture  
the vegan chorizo this is just 
the green salsa is is good like  
it has a great flavor winner it's it is spicy 
which is good it's not too spicy so i might  
add extra hot sauce but i think it lives up to 
the hype the food is beautiful it tastes good  
they have a lot of other things with their menu 
like tacos so yeah definitely worth checking out
there's so much to see in mexico city so if you 
want to see what the city is like walk the streets  
meet the people and eat the food 
catch you next time on rated v  
years this straight up gives me
so you get to a canal will you 
check if i'm in focus sorry
