This is the best rated pizza in the entire
world.
And we're going to be comparing it to the
world's most expensive pizza that has more gold than
my chain.
The top rated pizza in New York city that
uses a 100 year old oven and everything in
between.
And as crazy as it might sound, we're going
to start at Costco.
I've never actually had their pizza, but based on
countless articles I've found online, this is the internet's
favorite budget slice.
Do I think Costco pizza is going to beat
the slices we're going to have in New York
or Italy later in this video?
Probably not, but we won't know until we try.
Members only shouldn't be a problem.
Not the best photo though.
Fun fact, they sell so much pizza here at
Costco that technically they're one of the largest pizza
chains in the country.
I need to find out why people love it
so much.
So you think it could be the best in
the world?
Costco is the best.
We watched this pizza be made back there by
this robot machine that spreads the sauce perfectly.
The robot is so smart that as it gets
closer to the center, there's less sauce so that
your pizza can hold up and doesn't flop over.
They've just got everything down to a T where
it's all the same consistent, perfect pizza.
Thank you.
Hey, you want an extra drink?
Oh, an extra drink? Wow.
That's amazing.
Thank you.
So, I will say this pizza looks fantastic.
And our guy Greg seems to think it could
be up there with the best pizza in the
world.
The smell of this pizza alone is unbelievable.
This is the pizza that brings me back to
my childhood.
I feel like it's the very best version of
a pizza that you get at a birthday party.
I love it.
The only negatives for me is that there's no
crunch in this crust, and the bottom doesn't have
that classic pizza char I'm looking for.
This pizza right here exceeded my expectations, but the
real question is, can it hold up against the
best pizzas in the world?
This is Al Forno.
It's in Providence, Rhode Island, just a few minutes
away from the hospital where I was born.
And this is where grilled pizza was invented.
Grilled pizza has a more complex flavor than any
slice you've probably ever tasted.
And it's so good that at one point, it
won Al Forno the award for best casual restaurant
in the world.
How are you?
Good, how are you?
It's good to see you.
The last time I was in this kitchen was
when I was 17.
17 years old?
Yeah.
Are you 21 now?
I'm 27.
So, fun fact, this was my first ever job.
David was the chef.
Was I helpful?
Give me an honest rating.
Oh, yes, you were.
I remember.
I swept the floor a lot.
You were helpful, yes.
Do you think this deserves to be up there
with, like, the best pizzas in the world?
Because I actually do.
I do.
Oh, absolutely.
Because of all the care and time that we
take in making them.
It seems easy, but it's not that easy.
I promise you.
The whole process takes like, I don't know, three
minutes.
And David, Nick will be able to make one
too?
Absolutely.
Was he allowed to make one back in the
day?
No, he was not.
Any reason why?
Haha uh, he needs some training.
That right there is what makes a grilled pizza
a grilled pizza.
Those clean, fresh marks that go across it.
So what's the secret?
I mean, what makes this pizza so good?
Fresh ingredients, very simple.
Cooking it on a live fire like that, right
straight on.
Uh, David, I don't know if you remember this,
but one time I went to use the bathroom
when I was working here.
Uh-huh.
And I turned off the lights in the whole
restaurant.
Oh, I do remember that!
Yeah, everybody does that when they go.
Hahah!
That was pretty bad.
Did we scream at you?
Yeah, yeah, I think I got yelled at.
What the f*** are you doing?
I love all the little spots that you do
when you put them on there.
So unique in the sense that, like you said,
every pizza looks different.
It kind of breaks the rules of pizza.
Like, you know, the sauce is not first.
The cheese is first.
The cooking method is different.
Everything is different about it.
We got to rotate it constantly because some spots
are hotter than others.
Finish it with scallions.
And you don't really see scallions on a pizza
anywhere else.
No.
And the pizza's ready.
Another beautiful pizza.
Here we go.
So this is the first time I've ever been
allowed to touch pizza in this kitchen.
And this dough is so easy to work with.
It's so nice right now.
It's incredible.
Get these corners.
Get over here, you see.
And then when you go in there, you're going
to kind of open your hands a little bit.
Stretch it out even a little bit more.
Here we go.
And I'm going to drop.
Perfect.
I'm going to be honest, mine looks pretty sh**.
No, it looks beautiful.
I just, I'm not happy with how I dropped
it on there, David.
Oh, you're not?
That's okay.
Like I said, every single pizza looks different.
Can I try one more time?
Absolutely.
That looks good.
All right.
That looks good.
It's perfect.
Absolutely.
It looks beautiful.
Beautiful.
Bravo!
That's a little better.
No, that looks great.
That's better.
Now I'll pull it back and I'll flip it.
First a little bit of olive oil.
Here we go.
Yeah, like painting it.
Exactly.
And then we do the cheese.
Yeah, that looks good.
And just dump it in the middle.
And then spread it out.
Spread it out.
Now we're going to do the tomato sauce.
The idea is that every single bite has a
little bit of tomato and cheese.
Now we do herbs.
Perfect.
Just a little olive oil.
Yep.
And then we're going to push it back.
Looks gorgeous.
You did good.
We need somebody to work pizzas.
Would you come and work?
You should have let me touch the pizza when
I asked.
It's too late now.
Check the bottom, make sure it's not burning.
Looks good.
And then finish with the scallions.
Garnish the pizza with scallions.
I don't know if mine is good or yours,
but I feel good about it.
No, it's beautiful!
Show everyone how you eat the pizza here.
Fork and knife.
We use fork and knife.
Yep.
You cut it.
Look at that.
You're not gonna cut me a slice?
What I've always loved most about this is that
it looks so thin, but it's got a really
nice chew to it.
It's chewy, crispy.
It's got like a little bit of that acidic
bite to it from one of the cheeses.
All right, well, if you ever need help making
the pizzas.
You know where to find me.
This right here is Frank Pepe's.
This is Dave Portnoy's favorite place to get a
slice.
Dave has reviewed thousands of pizzas through his Barstool
Pizza Reviews.
And this restaurant here is based in New Haven,
Connecticut, which many say is the pizza hub of
America.
If you look up best pizza in America, this
place is top three on every list.
What's going on, guys?
Hey, what's happening?
How you doing?
I figured you guys would be happy I'm seeing
some Connecticut-style pizza before New York City, which...
Absolutely. We love to showcase off our coal-fired oven.
Frank Pepe is the birthplace of coal-fired pizza in
New Haven, Connecticut.
So right here is a custom 100,000 pound coal
fire brick oven.
This is the powerhouse of the pizza that they
make here.
So this right here is 2,000 degrees inside.
A new fire starts every day.
It burns your eyes.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Every 30 minutes to an hour, we'll flip the
fire just to get the old ash down, add
some new coals.
Remember, just like any fire, you need oxygen to
breathe.
So if you flick this fan on, that pushes
air through here and gives really nice airflow into
their oven, which is what cooks the perfect pie.
Should we make a pizza?
We have a bread flour, not a pizza flour.
So it's a little looser.
So you want to get under it with a
little flour, and then you just want to grab
around the edges.
You're not throwing it up in the air.
You're not making a circle and throwing it.
It'll make a hole in there.
No throwing dough in here.
Nope.
So how many pizzas do you make a day
here?
On a busy day, you can do over 1,000.
Wow.
People love pizza.
So level scoop.
Put it in the middle.
You're going to write like a pencil.
Oh, that's great.
I could write my name into it.
It all just circles into it.
Sliced mozzarella cheese.
Yep.
This actually is a big key for us.
Ok.
It melts different.
Then we have our Pecorino Romano, our olive oil.
And then this is the hardest part.
Ok.
Is throwing it in.
The key is just throw it.
You don't want to get scared.
You get to your point, shake.
It's finesse, I like it.
Okay, this is nice, light, airy dough.
Look at that.
We make our dough fresh every day.
And it kind of spreads itself, like you said.
A little bit of farina on here.
Toss it right on.
Honestly, I'll say, I could have made it a
little more circular.
It's okay, it all tastes the same.
One scoop, right in the center.
Once I put it in the center, I like
that you're kind of like drawing with a pencil.
Food is always art, isn't it?
It is.
It's nice to have that cheese a little bit
dry before you make that pizza though, that way
you're not going to have this wet, leaking pizza.
A little bit of pecorino, just a little bit
of olive oil to finish it off, and then
we're good.
Alright, this is the toughest part.
I don't want to hit anyone with this thing.
So everybody duck, alright?
Alright, I'm going to go all the way in.
All right, about 10 minutes later, my pizza should
be done.
It definitely looks good.
Let's see.
Beautiful.
Wow, that is a good looking pizza.
We did the hardest part.
We actually made the pizza.
So now the only question is, how does it
taste?
Right off the bat, I have to say this
is a damn good looking pizza.
I can tell that crust is nice and crispy
and it's definitely nice and hot.
If I'm being honest, I just don't see how
you can get a better pizza than this, but...
New York and Connecticut have always been in a
fight on who has the better pie.
So let's go see.
Can Connecticut's best beat New York's best?
We made it to New York City, and after
searching through over 2,000 pizza restaurants, I've decided to
visit this one.
It's literally called Best Pizza.
Best Pizza serves up classic New York-style slices.
Everything is baked in a custom oven that's bigger
than a lot of New York City apartments.
This is an 100-year-old oven about?
Yeah, it's like 130 years old.
And how big is this oven?
So I'll show you right now.
People always flip out when I bring them to
this part because this is literally the whole, this
is the whole oven.
The oven goes all the way back?
Yeah, it's the size of a one car garage.
It's very similar.
Like if you go to Frank Pepe's in New
Haven, and if you go to like a lot
of those pizzerias that have been around for a
hundred years, Frank Pepe has the same exact oven
as us.
We just went to Frank Pepe's.
Yeah.
Sounds like all the best pizzas come out of
the same oven.
Big shout out to Frank Pepe's.
You call this place best pizza for a reason,
right?
Yeah, I mean, you know, that's what some say.
We'll let you be the judge.
Let's make some pies.
Yo, I'm coming into the kitchen real quick, guys,
right behind you.
This is crazy.
So the main goal is to kind of not
touch your crust when you're making it.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, the crust kind of makes itself.
When I'm making the pizza, a lot of pizzerias,
you see pizza guys smacking the s*** out of
the pizza, you know.
I want to keep the air inside because that's
what keeps the slice nice and light.
So you're pretty delicate with it when you put
it down.
Delicate, that's exactly what I teach all my pizza
guys.
Get it up into your hands and then this
is when it starts spreading out.
I haven't seen a technique like this before.
Yeah, you just kind of flip it.
Gravity is your friend with pizza making.
You know, you see people throw it in the
air, and it is a trick and people love
watching it, but it actually helps the pizza spread
out.
We've seen a lot of pizzas in this video.
This is the biggest, biggest pizza we've seen.
Biggest one so far?
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, you know, if you're talking about
how big the actual, you know, pizza dough is,
but to get it to this size without having
any little holes or thin parts in it.
Yeah.
It takes time.
You gotta make a lot of pizzas, and that's
what I tell young pizza makers.
First thing is the tomatoes.
When the pizza cooks, the crust puffs up and
it pushes all the ingredients to the middle.
So what you want to do is kind of
get everything to the outside rim.
This is our oregano.
We use the oregano on the stem.
This is what makes a New York pizza, in
my opinion.
Oregano?
The dried oregano.
If you go to Italy, you go around and
eat a New York slice.
If you keep that in your mind, you'll be
like, oh, I taste the oregano.
This reminds me of New York.
It's a powerful herb, especially when it's dried.
So we don't go too heavy.
Pretty light on the cheese from what it looks
like, too.
Big time.
I'm not big in just having a big cheesy
slice.
And you're also putting more of that cheese on
the outside, just like you talked about, to make
sure it's not being weighed down, yeah?
Exactly.
So this fresh mozzarella, it spreads a lot, so
you don't need to use as much as normal
pizzerias do.
And then we're going to go right in.
Coming right behind.
There it goes.
You got the launch down to a science, huh?
Yeah, it's a lot of years, you know?
The oven's so hot, as soon as the pizza
gets in there, it pops right up.
You can see all those bubbles forming.
Oh, man.
Yeah, it looks nice.
This is a technique.
Sometimes we'll take it and dome it, and let
the top of that fire, just kiss the top
of the pie.
Doming it?
Yeah, because the top is a dome.
Yup, and that's where all the heat is.
So the higher you go, the hotter the temperature.
For me, I don't want the pie to look
perfect.
I want it to look rustic, you know?
We try to mix the old with the new,
and I think that's what makes our spot special.
Come on, boys, eat up.
Grab a slice.
This is what it's about, right?
It's passing the food around and eating it.
Oh, that's it.
That's what we're looking for in New York.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Mm, that's the sound of pizza.
That's it, baby.
I would just call it the perfect well-rounded slice.
You're not doing anything fancy, but you're doing everything
right.
Thank you, man.
That is the best pizza, huh?
Come visit Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Come see this handsome guy.
Our next stop is Industry Kitchen, home to the
world's most expensive pizza.
And I figure if you've got the world's most
expensive ingredients, it's gotta be pretty damn good.
Are you ready to see how we make our
24K pizza?
As ready as I'll ever be.
Should we do it?
Yeah, absolutely.
Come over.
All right, let's go.
There's a lot of stuff happening back here.
This is Luis.
Luis, how are you?
Luis is going to start the dough.
It's a black dough.
It's made with cobblefish ink.
So that makes it super, super black.
There's a little earthy tones to it in the
flavor profile.
I feel like you might be the only place
in the world with a black dough pizza.
First, we start with a roasted garlic cream.
That's our base instead of a tomato base.
Definitely not a traditional pizza.
It's not.
The second layer is mozzarella cheese.
So this is a Stilton cheese from England.
The best we can get is a blue cheese.
How often are you making one of these?
About 15 to 20 a year.
This oven is like a gas oven, but also
we have apple wood.
So you've got gas and wood in this oven.
Yeah, so the gas is for the temperature to
make the bottom very crispy.
Then that is for the smoke and flavor of
the pizza.
Foie gras, this one is the liver of a
goose.
It's coming from the Hudson Valley.
It's so decadent.
Almost like a fancy butter.
A fancy animal butter, yeah.
So the pizza's finished its first bake.
Yes.
How many slices do we have here?
Eight slices.
$250 per slice.
Oh sh**.
Time for the gold.
So each slice gets a nice big square, huh?
Absolutely.
Yeah, we are not shy with our gold.
This is actually 24 karat gold.
Absolutely, yeah.
So instead of putting this on a wedding ring
or on a chain or in a watch, this
is on a pizza.
This is on a pizza.
All right, so we have the gold.
Now we are going with our other ingredients.
So that foie gras just baked in that oven
for a little bit, and now you're placing that
onto the pizza as well.
Now we have the caviar.
It's a beautiful Ossetra caviar from Iran.
And again, you're putting one nice big spoonful on
every single slice.
That's correct.
We're trying to achieve the full flavor profile, umami,
in this pizza.
Then we have some beautiful edible flowers.
And this part I love because the colors start
to really pop.
Well, we have the benefit of the black dough.
That's a nice canvas of art, right?
Now we have some more textures of gold.
So there wasn't enough gold on there?
No.
No, there was not enough gold.
And we're going to model the pizza with truffle.
Oh my God.
Nick, this is your 24K golden pizza.
One more little surprise here.
I actually brought one of my best friends from
high school who has no idea what he's about
to eat.
He's also kind of a picky eater.
You ready to eat some pizza?
I'm ready.
Let's do it.
Let's go.
Wow.
Thank you so much.
What do you think?
Crazy.
I don't think there's enough gold.
Believe it or not, this is the most expensive
pizza you can buy.
In New York?
Anywhere.
Really?
Guess how much each slice costs.
$100?
$250.
Have you eaten gold before?
No.
All right, let's go.
Wow.
That's insane.
I taste a lot of the Stilton blue cheese.
It's like a super powerful, powerful cheese.
I got a big fat bite of foie gras
when I bit in, so it's all buttery.
Did you like the foie gras?
I loved it.
Wait so is foie gras like super expensive?
Yeah.
I love the fact that there's a bunch of
different cheeses and I love the look of the
dough, even though it tastes just like regular old
pizza dough.
All around, give it a pizza rating.
You like pizza.
Pizza rating out of 10?
I mean, in terms of how unique it is,
10 out of 10.
Kind of unbeatable.
I think it's the best slice I've ever had,
to be honest.
Is it?
It's not every day you have some gold pizza
with caviar.
This is your top pizza that you've ever had?
I think so.
Wow.
I'm going to tell everyone I had some gold
pizza today.
All right.
Let's see the damage.
You got this one?
Yeah, I'll take it.
This is the first bill you've ever picked up
for us.
Have a good day!
For our final pizza, I flew to Italy in
search of the number one rated pizzeria in the
entire world.
And I decided to have a little bit of
fun along the way.
Did you really think I wasn't going to pull
up to the best pizza restaurant in the world
in style?
There are over 250,000 pizza restaurants in the entire
world.
And behind me is number one.
This is I Masanielli, a pizzeria just outside of
Naples, Italy, that was just ranked number one in
the world by a panel of 900 judges on
the most prestigious pizza rankings list.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Head chef Francesco Martucci has invited us into his
kitchen to learn how he makes the best pizza
in the entire world.
So my brother here, Pete, speaks great Italian.
So he's going to be helping us translate today.
Let's make the dough first.
Okay. Are you ready?
I'm ready! So I'm curious, how did you get
so good at making pizza?
I started at 10 years old out of necessity.
I was a kid I had to help out
at home.
At home we didn't have heat or gas. I
started out by washing plates and bathrooms in pizzerias.
And then slowly step by step I got closer
to the pizza table. And then it became my
life.
Now is when he really gets to develop that
gluten.
We'll knead until we get a consistency without lumps.
Then when we begin to see that the dough
starts to come apart, we put it into the
bowl.
Where it will rest for an hour. See you
later!
I'm starting with a classic Margherita pizza. San Marzano
tomatoes. I like to put some basil on before
and after it cooks because it gives it some
character. We put it under the mozzarella and it
doesn't burn in the oven.
Add some extra virgin olive oil before and after
cooking it.
I put a little before because the temperature of
the oil goes up much more than the other
ingredients and it helps cook the tomatoes. That pizza
just cooked faster than we could film it, and
it's done.
The addition of that oil completely transforms that pizza
I like the oven on a low flame because
a bigger flame would cook the outside and not
the center of the pizza, and voila!
That was it? That pizza just cooked faster than
we could film it, and it's done. That was
it.
It was fast because it was just one pizza
in the oven
He's using the scissors to cut the pizza.
This is a very classic Italian style.
Why do they cut with scissors?
That is the lightest crust I've ever felt in
my life.
It tastes like Italy.
The crust is so soft and light.
They got the perfect crisp and char on the
outside.
Pizza needs to melt, like chocolate
That's the first time I've heard a pizza compared
to a chocolate.
That's a good pizza. So who gets the last
slice?
Luckily, we didn't have to fight as the chef
made us one more pie.
His specialty deep fried pizza, futuro di marinara.
Oh my God.
That is a crazy crisp.
Mmm, you hear that?
This crust is amazing!
That is insane.
This is the best pizza crust that I think
I've ever had.
You got to make it in America!
You know what's funny, guys? I just realized this.
I was taking a shower, and it's 6.42 p.m.
on Thursday evening.
It's been like a week since I filmed this
video, and I just remembered I didn't even pick
my favorite slice of pizza.
And that was like half the reason I filmed
the whole video.
So, sorry about that.
