They're all good.

(bell dings)
Question number one.
What was the Disneyland location used for
before it was a theme park?
- I don't know, actually. A parking lot.
- Hotel.
- No.
- Dang it.
- McDonald's.
- Apartments?
- No.
- Like, sports?
- [Ash] Mm-mm.
- No.
- You guys are thinking very commercial.
- Okay.
- Think more agriculture.
- A dairy farm.
- [Ash] No.
- Some sort of farm.
- Close.
- Oh, an apple orchard.
No, I'm just kidding.
- [Ash] Close, but no.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh my God.
(Sylvia gasps)
- An orange tree farm.
- It was an orange grove.
- Correct.
- Dang it!
- I can't believe I knew that.
- Like lemon and lime?
- Citrus.
- So close.
- Citrus farm.
- Orange.
- Correct.
- Oranges.
- Oh my God,
an orange grove, obviously.
Literally, an orange grove in California.
- That makes so much sense.
- [Ash] All right, Jayka, you knew it,
so you get to chew it.
Let's see what you're eating.
- [Jayka] Oh my gosh.
- Oh!
- Whoa.
- Let's go.
- And it's like a Mickey.
- [Video] 50th anniversary treats.
- Wow.
- [Video] The Mickey
cinnamon roll.
- Mm.
- Cute.
- Wow.
- Oh.
Oh my gosh. I can smell it.
- It's so magical.
- I can smell it.
- And I didn't even eat breakfast.
- [Ash] This is arguably one of the cutest
and tastiest Mickey-shaped
foods in the park.
The jumbo Mickey cinnamon roll.
- Nice. I'm gonna take a little bite.
- Dang.
Dang.
- I'm gonna pick up the whole thing.
Yeah, just let me.
- Yeah.
Oh my gosh. Nice.
(light music)
- You earned that all
by yourself. How is it?
- It's really good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah?
- I love cinnamon rolls.
- This is probably the best
cinnamon roll of my life.
- It really does conjure
up the Disneyland feeling.
Man, this is so good.
I love cinnamon rolls.
- Doesn't Mickey-shaped
food just taste better?
- Yeah, it does.
- Everything Mickey-shaped
always tastes better.
- Oh my gosh.
- Although I do feel bad,
it's kinda like I'm eating Mickey Mouse.
- It doesn't even have eyes. You're fine.
- Sylvia, how are you feeling?
- I mean, a little sad.
- Yeah.
- Off to a rough start.
- If I ask you guys a question
and neither of you know the answer,
then neither of you get to
chew it and I get to chew it.
And you don't want big,
bad chef Ash chewing it.
- No.
- We can't let her get that.
- No. No, we can't.
- No.
(bell dings)
- What is the final
ingredient that young Tiana
adds to her gumbo?
- Hot sauce.
- I didn't even finish my question.
- Didn't ask.
- All right, Brian.
- What?
I know that I'm, apparently,
I'm gonna have to be speedy.
- I will give you this one,
but I swear to God, Brian,
if you don't let me finish
my question here on forth.
- Does it go to me?
- Okay.
- It goes to Alex.
- Okay.
- Cayenne pepper.
- Mm-mm.
- What is in gumbo?
- She pours something, I feel like.
- Love.
- No.
- Okay, I know the scene-
- Like hot sauce.
- Because they're literally
like, and then after she's like,
"Hey, everybody, I made gumbo."
- I'm gonna say hot sauce.
- Correct.
(Jayka and Jillian cheering)
- Good job.
- Is it hot sauce?
- Correct.
- Oh my God.
- Yes. Yes.
- Three, two, one.
- Oh my God, Jillian.
- I'm so into it.
- Oh, that looks tasty.
- That looks bomb.
- Get a little shot
of that right there.
- [Sylvia] Oh, yeah.
- Have you been to Tiana's Palace yet?
- What?
- It just opened.
- No, I haven't.
- Oh my God.
- I haven't been.
- The lines are literally
like four hours long.
- I've never actually had gumbo.
- [Ash] Oh, really?
- So this is gonna be
a first for me.
(light music)
- [Sylvia] Darn it.
- Mm.
- Oh, wait. I need to tell you what it is.
From the newly opened Tiana's
Palace House at Disneyland,
we've got a bowl of their
delicious house gumbo
made with just the right
amount of hot sauce.
- Can I just smell it?
- Yeah, get in there.
- Oh, that smells amazing.
- That's just, like, insane.
Oh my gosh. Okay.
- [Jayka] Get a good bite.
(light music)
- Mm.
- [Jayka] That looked
so satisfying.
- Mm-hm.
- [Alexander] Go with
the sausage and the rice.
- It's just stick to your ribs food.
You know what I mean?
- Stick to your ribs?
- I'm so glad I knew it.
- I wanna take this, like,
home, but the recipe.
- Are you guys excited for the new
Princess and the Frog ride?
- Yes, I'm so excited.
- [Yeshua] There's a ride?
- [Ash] Yeah.
- Oh, shoot.
- They're, like, changing
Splash Mountain into-
- Okay.
- Like a Tiana Ride.
- Fire.
- I'm so excited.
- That sounds cool.
- Love Splash Mountain. 100%.
Outdated? Yes. 100%.
With all of the other things
that you have switched up,
it's about time that you switch up
one of the most outdated
things that you have done.
- Yeah.
(bell dings)
What household snack was
invented at Disneyland?
- Oh, invented.
- A snack was invented at Disneyland?

- Candy apples.
- [Ash] No.
- Lollipops.
- [Ash] No.
- Chips. Like, is it a type of chip?
- Type of chip, so yes.
- A potato chip.
- Mm-mm.
- And Disneyland, like, created it-
- Mm-hm.
- Or just made it popular?
- They created it.
- Lays chips.
- [Ash] Mm-mm.
- Fritos.
- [Ash] Very close.
- Doritos.
- Correct.
- Wait, really?
- Yes.
You're close.
- Doritos.
- Correct.
- What?
- Doritos?
- Doritos.
- Correct.
- Oh my God, that's right.
It was created at the Frito Restaurant.
- [Ash] Let's take a look.
- What?
- No way. Check this out.
- It's a cake, a funnel
cake on top of a hot dog.
- I love hot dogs, guys.
This is not even funny.
- [Video] What's my favorite thing
to eat at the Magic Kingdom?
It's the 50th celebration hotdog
at Casey's Corner on Main Street.
- Magic Kingdom. Yeah.
- [Video] It is crazy delicious.
- Is it like a funnel cake?
Oh!
- I'm a big funnel cake guy.
- Really?
- So this is a big loss for me.
- [Ash] One of the crazier dishes offered
at Casey's Corner in Magic Kingdom,
we've got the 50th celebration hotdog
with strawberry bacon jam,
crispy funnel cake, and powdered sugar.
- I'm so jealous right now.
I bet the strawberry jam
with it too is insane.
(light music)
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah?
(light music)
- That is good.
- Does it work?
Like, you like the sweet and savory?
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, this works a lot.
- Okay.
- Wow.
- That is amazing.
- Wow. I'm shocked.
- No, I'm not, because
this is such a bright idea.
Like, a hot dog and
funnel cake, but in one.
- This is awful, but I would
eat this for breakfast.
Like a sausage, a bacon.
- Oh, like a breakfast sausage?
- Yeah.
- There's something so, like, caveman
about liking a hot dog, you know?
I like hot dogs.
- And see, I don't feel like it's caveman.
I feel like it's American.
(bell dings)
- From which Disneyland attraction
does the owner of Trader
Sam's Grog Grotto originate?
- Who's Trader Sam?
- A trader.
- Oh, like a traitor? Or like a trader?
- No.
- I think like a trader.
- Think of, like, Trader
Joe. But this is Trader Sam.
- Is it his cousin?
- Sure.
- Trader Sam.
- Trader Sam's.
- Okay, so Trader Sam's
is in Frontier Land.
- Oh.
- [Alexander] Trader Sam's.

a movie made about it.

- Grog's grotto.
- Jungle Cruise.
- Correct.
(Jayka screams)
- The Jungle Cruise.
- Correct.
- Dang it.
- Damn it. I can literally see it too.
I can see it. I waited in that line.
- All right, Sylvia.
That was your win again.
- Took an L.
- Let's see what you're gonna eat.
- Okay.
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
- [Yeshua] What the heck?
- Oh my God.
- [Video] You know about
Disney's Tonga Toast, right?
- Tonga Toast.
- [Video] Disney's
Polynesian Village Resort.
- Okay.
- Wow.
- [Video] Inspired items like
these macadamia nut pancakes
and grilled ham.
- Oh.
- [Video] But the signature
item is Tonga Toast,
a banana stuffed sourdough French toast
rolled in cinnamon sugar, served
with a strawberry compote.
- What?
- [Video] Spiced ham, bacon, or sausage.
This $17 breakfast item is
- $17?
- Wait, that's, like,
kind of a steal.
- I mean, it's huge.
It's huge.
- I love bananas.
- I love banana, too.
I put it in every dessert I can.
- Me too.
- [Ash] This is my favorite
dish in all of Disney's parks.
A deep fried banana stuffed
delectable breakfast item
called Tonga Toast, which
is found at the Kona Cafe
in Disney's Polynesian
Resort in Disney World.
- Guys, what did I do to deserve this?
Just know my Disney facts.
- You know things.
You know trivia.
- [Jayka] I'm so smart.
- Honestly, we all know,
usually not a big fan of
sweets, but that looks insane.
Okay, take a little
dip. Take a little dip.
- Holy (beep). This is incredible.
(light music)
- [Jayka] I'm doing this.
(Jillian gasping)
- I can't look. I can't look.
- This is the best day ever.
- [Jillian] Covering my
ears, closing my eyes.
- Oh my God.
- It's even like
the crunch too.
- Gotta love Hawaiian food, man.
Hawaiians really know what they're doing.
- [Ash] Yeah.
- Oh my God.
- [Yeshua] Duh. I don't want to hear it.
I don't wanna hear it.
- I'm so sorry for you.
- I'm gonna cry.
- So The Polynesian is where The Beatles
officially broke up.
- Oh my God.
- That's pretty sad.
- That's kind of, like, funny,
but like, also, like, really sucks.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
John Lennon was visiting Florida.
I think he was visiting Disney World,
and that's where the paperwork
was delivered to him,
and he signed his signature
to end The Beatles.
- At Disney World?
- Mm-hm.
- That is so, like,
anticlimactic, you know?
- It's, like, him at the happiest place.
- Yeah. Like, and also very ironic.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Disney World didn't
exist at that point, right?
- [Ash] Mm-hm.
- It did?
- No, it did.
- I wonder if being there made it better
or if it ruined his experience.
Like, he can never go back, you know?
- I don't think he can go back anyways.
I don't think he's alive.
- Wait, John Lennon's dead?
- She's like, "Wait, that guy's
really not alive right now?
No way."
- I'm like,
"What are you talking about?"

locations in Disneyland
where you can buy alcohol?

The Edge of Tomorrow.

I'll give it to both of you.
Neither of you knew it,
so no one gets to chew it.
- Oh.
- I'm so mad.
Oh!
- What is that?
- [Brian] What the (beep) is that?
- [Ash] Headphones on.
- It looks like a calzone.

- [Video] If you're at Disneyland.
- Oh, it's in Toontown.
- Okay.
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.
- Me.
- Oh.
- [Ash] Is it a pizza or is
it a calzone? Why choose?
From Cafe Daisy and Mickey's Toontown,
we've got a kooky but
delicious concoction.
A cheese pizza flop over topped
with Parmesan and parsley.
- Wow.
- [Ash] And because
neither of you knew it.
- You get to chew it.
- Yes. Okay. Wow.
- [Alexander] Is that just
covered in Parmesan too?
- Mm-hm.
- That does look good.
- Mm-hm.
- Nice job, Ash.
- Thank you.
- Oh boy. Hold on, let me.
- [Sylvia] Heck yeah.
I love pizza.
- A flop over.
- Yep. Flop over.
- They didn't even think
hard for the name. Yeah.
- They literally just took
a pizza, sliced it up,
and then said, "Hold on. What if?"
- Oh my God. I'm so
confused. How do I eat this?
Like, what is the right-
- Get in there.
Get in there.
- Wrong or right way?
- [Ash] Go for it, girl.
Stop overthinking it.
- Oh my God.
(light music)
- Yo. Holy (beep).
- Whoa.
- This is so good.
- [Ash] Yeah?
(bell dings)
What was the first Disney Park
built outside of the United States?
- That would be,
out of the United States, that
would be Disneyland Paris.
- Euro Disney.
- No. Neither one of you got it correct.
- Was it in Japan?
- Mm-hm.

Was it the Disneyland in Japan?
- What's the name?
- Is there a different name for it?
- Wait, the first

- [Ash] Correct. Yeah,
it's Tokyo Disneyland.
- Okay, I'm just saying it backwards.
Got it, got it, got it.
- [Brian] Ash, I swear to God.
Nobody calls it Tokyo Disneyland.
And I hate you for that.
- If you love all things Baymax.
- That's so cute.
- Oh my God. That's so cute.
- [Video] Tokyo Disney.
- See? Did you hear what he said?
- Well, he's wrong.
- I'm being gaslit right now
and it's driving me up the wall.
- Dude, this looks identical.
- Wow. Y'all really flew
to Tokyo this morning.
- [Video] Decapitating him, but you know.
- Taking it a little far there, brother.
- [Ash] Traveling all the
way to Tokyo Disneyland,
our winners get to chow
down on this warm, cozy bowl
of Baymax curry that has both
beef and a chicken curry.
- Cute.
- It's so cute.
- Oh my gosh, it's so adorable. Okay.
(Alexander yelling)
- [Brian] Why?
- Oops.
Mm. That's really good.
- [Ash] Yeah?
- Oh, that's really good.
- Look at his blood.
- [Brian] Blood?
- His blood.
It's orange because he's a robot.
(rock music)
It's great.
- I'm so mad.
I'm so mad right now.
- This is so good.
- Oh my gosh. Okay.
- Are you a chicken girl?
- Greens first.
- Yeah. Broccoli.
- Mm. Mm.
- [Jayka] Is it good?
- Mm-hm.
- Dude, it looks amazing.
- The chicken curry, oh my gosh.
- I'm getting a little
bit of the beef side.
Get a little bit of both.
- That looks good.
(light music)
- Mm.
- Brian, how are you feeling
about losing this one?
- I'm gonna let them take care of that.
I don't need to worry about this anymore.
- How do you feel about eating Baymax?
- Pretty good about it.
He tastes pretty tasty.
- Yeah?
- You know what I'm saying?
- That looks so good with the rice.
- Mm-hm.
That's really tasty.
- So fun fact, popcorn is one
of the most popular
snacks at Tokyo Disneyland
in Tokyo Disney Sea as they are known.
- Did you see how hard
she hit that L in land
on purpose?
- Land.
As they're known for their unique flavors
and collectible popcorn buckets.
Their flavors include soy
sauce, strawberry, chocolate,
and honey that vary seasonally.
- Soy sauce flavored popcorn?
- Ooh.
I would love that.
- Yep.
- Dude, I told you, Tokyo
is on another level.
- Another level.
- Ooh, I feel like soy sauce
popcorn would be really good.
- [Ash] Right?
- Strawberry popcorn I'm here for.
- That also sounds really good.
- I'm here for that.
- All right, well-
- Sorry.
- We are going into our final round.
- Uh-oh.
(bell dings)
- All right, let's see how
Ash gaslights me this time.
- Or maybe I'll just
be really good, Brian.
Did you ever consider that?
- No.
- [Ash] Open.
- I'm just like.
- What was the first Mickey-shaped food
served in the Disney parks?
- Sorry. That count?
- Yeah, you go.
- Ice cream.
- No.
- Ice cream bar. Gotta be.
- [Ash] No.
- No, it's the pretzel.
- [Ash] No.
- What?
- Sandwich.
- [Ash] No.
- The cookie.
- [Ash] No.
- Like a, oh my gosh. Wait.
A grilled cheese.
- [Ash] No.
- I'm just thinking about like,
what can you shape Mickey
to look like that's food?
Oh, pancakes.
- [Ash] Correct.
(light music)
- Did you see that?
Did you see the way I, like,
kind of was like, "Well"?
- You were working through that.
- Yeah.
- Chicken.
- No.
(Sylvia and Ash laughing)
- Pancakes.
- Correct.
- No!
- Yes! Yes!
- Grilled cheese?
- Okay, I have no idea.
- Waffles.
- No, but close.
- Pancake.
- Correct.
- I'm pretty proud of myself right now.
- Brian.
- Wow, I wiped the floor with you.
- Someone's a little sore loser.
All right, three, two, one.
- Oh, wow.
- Yep. Yep.
I told you'd call a
Jack-Jack Cookie Num Num.
- Num Num.
(Jillian and Jayka laughing)
- Oh!
- Oh.
- It's pretty good.
- How can there be too
much milk chocolate?
- Oh.
- Very cute.
- [Ash] And finally, going back
to Disney's California Adventure Park,
we've got a plate of the most
perfect sweet for any kid.
The mouth-wateringly thick and gooey
Jack-Jack Num Num Cookie.
(light music)
- Num Num.
- Jack-Jack knows what he wants.
(light music)
- Feeling good?
- Mm-hm.
That's good.
- Is it soft?
- Very soft. I don't know
what she was talking about.
This is not dry. This is good.
- Did you see how melty that is?
- Yeah, that's amazing.
- Ooey gooey.
- Ooey gooey, fresh out the oven.
- Oh, it's like slightly
underbaked, which is my favorite.
- Oh, that's the best way.
- This one hurt the most.
- [Ash] Yeah.
- I'm just gonna break a little piece off.
You just want some? Just kidding. (laughs)
- I didn't even fall for it that time.
- Brian, what a good
time I've had with you.
- You know what?
I like doing videos with you.
- Me too.
- Yeah.
Ash, you're over there.
- Okay, Nicole, trivia question.
Who's the sexiest Disney character?
- Stitch. Stitch. I love Stitch.
- Wrong. It's David
from "Lilo and Stitch".
Ooh!
But we can eat this together.
- Yay!
- I'll break my own rules.
- All right.
- Thank you guys so much
for watching this episode
of "Knew It and Chew It".
