had so far is one of the best chefs that
I've walked on like the better
well it's hard for us right because
obviously we're coming we're coming in I
loved it and people are going to think
it's just because we're here in his Pub
but you can verify me on this that food

it's the best we're going for a goal
this year so we'll get it it's the real
deal it is it's proper field proper food
nice maintenance
safe home congratulations
cheers thanks very much
well there we are for everyone
um
I was really unsure what to expect here
at the black Forge in an
I haven't got a bad word to say about it
in fact
it's all positives the team were on
point they were energetic they were
polite they were well drilled it was a
slick service the food was delicious
particularly those wings the steak was
delicious we got the whiskey flame steak
as well a nice little addition
and the desserts showed a real class and
intent and the Stout they're doing as
well
was fantastic
everything about what we've experienced
today was delicious
I don't mean that I really mean that
come and try it for yourself and another
thing it wasn't overpriced nonsense too
very very nicely priced all of that was
a very reasonable amount for example our
Stakes were 36 quid each for a nice
piece of Irish fill it
cooking on the stone as well so you can
take it off top it up salt it yourself
absolutely [ __ ] brilliant loved it
highly recommend if you're in the area
come down and give it a go you will not
be let down by the services it's a slick
operation that whoever's in charge of
running this shot
Bravo and there's only one thing left to
do now let's give it a score All Things
Considered
I want to give this
a 9 out of ten
Big Score like
for me 90 of food when you go out
someone like this is about the service
and how you feel when you're there
is there an atmosphere is there a Vibe
what's the service like that all pieces
together it doesn't matter how good the
food is if you get service it wrecks
everything
leaves a bitter taste in your mouth and
I've walked out of there today with a
very sweet taste in my mouth I'm smiling
on the inside and on the outside
wasn't sure whether it's coming or not
I'm really glad we did thanks for
watching everyone and that
that's a review see you speak Daddy on a
mission to find it's got the fastest
freshest food in the kitchen different
places different flavors try different
things
who's the king of Kebabs where's the
boss of the burger
