Salt
Spaghettoni - 250g
Cook spaghettoni al dente
Parmesan - 40g
Pancetta - 100g
Fry without oil until golden brown
We reduce the fire, put the cooked spaghettoni in a slightly cooled pan of
water in which pasta is cooked,
pour the sauce on top and stir
The temperature in the  Pan should be high enough to melt the cheese and thicken the sauce
At the same time, it shouldn't be too high so the egg white doesn't curdle
Grate the cheese and add a pinch of black pepper for flavor
The classic pasta carbonara is  complete!
Mmmm.... very tasty!  💖
Thanks for watching!  Bon appetit!  💖
