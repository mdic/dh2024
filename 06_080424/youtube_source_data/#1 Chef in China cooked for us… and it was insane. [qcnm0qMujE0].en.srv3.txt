This is the best Chinese chef in 2023.
What?
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
You're a genius.
One in a billion.
One in a billion.
Absolutely incredible.
Here we go.
We are in a restaurant.
I don't even believe is open yet.
They've opened it especially for us.
Can we talk about the gondola,
that we had to get in to get to this restaurant.
It went over a literal performing lake,
that they turned on, just for us.
The Head Chef, Chef Tam literally won
the Best Chef in all of China Award.
In all of China?
That's like a billion people.
Chef Tam is a one in a billion.
He's a one in a billion.
Oh gosh, first dish already.
That looks like it's a crab.
This is our appetiser.
We used local crab meat.
Mushroom and onion.
Stuffed in the crab shell.
That's in a crab head.
But that's not all crab.
It's heavy.
Feel how heavy that is.
- Oh, it's very heavy
- It's spiky.
I don't even know how you lifted it.
Well I pincered it like a crab.
Oh my gosh.
Is that cheese?
Crispy layer on top soft in the middle.
Oh the crap meat.
The thing is top of a macaroni cheese,
is one of the best things in the world, right?
Okay, that's not what it is.
Wow.
Wow.
It does taste like macaroni cheese with crab in.
The crab is so fresh
This is the second thing we've 
been served in a crab head.
And it is incredible.
Mate, I finished mine.
Flippen polished that off.
That was incredible.
I want someone to validate my macaroni cheese.
I've sat in the perfect spot today.
Yeah, Luke is just going to slide on over.
It's craboroni cheese.
No, don't say that.
I think that's cheese.
Yeah but it's not macaroni.
No it's not macaroni.
Oh, Chef Tam.
Hi.
Thank you for having us.
That was incredible.
It was amazing.
Is there cheese in that?
Um...
No cheese.
- No cheese!
- What?
I called it.
It's a mixture of egg yolk 
and good quality butter.
Butter!
Which is why it tasted so creamy.
Yes, yes.
Chef Tam, I've heard that 
you're the best chef in China.
Congratulations!
- Yeah, it's amazing!
- Congratulations!
Not to put you on the spot but 
congratulations on that award.
That is amazing.
What is this.
It is bone marrow from big size of sturgeon.
Sturgeon?
Fish bone marrow.
Try it out in the soup.
Okay, okay.
The next dish is a soup you've made.
This. Wow.
It's beautiful.
Wow.
Wow.
After cooking, this is what it looks like.
Some chicken?
Chicken, no it's not chicken.
- What's this?
- Very nice, you know, poultry.
- Poultry.
- It's poultry. What is it?
Is it pigeon?
Not pigeon.
It's a mystery?
Yeah, it's a mystery.
Okay.
- Do you know?
- Mystery meat.
- I know.
- He knows.
Yeah, it's a fixed menu.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you Chef Tam.
- This is amazing.
- Amazing.
- Wow, I love him.
- I love him.
I absolutely love Chef Tam.
I'm a fan of him.
I'm a tambourine.
Okay, is that what you are calling his fans?
Look at that.
It's almost like gelatinous on the outside.
This is the first time I've 
actually looked it in the eye.
You scared?
How do you bite through it?
With some difficulty.
Very gelatinous on the outside.
Extremely chewy on the inside.
Almost like rubber.
Yeah, I don't love it.
Okay.
Sorry, I swallowed a big bit of it and I gagged.
Are you meant to eat that?
Yeah, surely.
- You sure it's not are you sure it's not flavour.
- He gave it to us.
No, of course I'm not sure.
It's my first time ever eating it.
This,
Oh my gosh, are you okay?
I'm trying to keep a straight face.
Chef Tam was right there,
- and he's a really sweet man.
- Is he there?
No, he's gone. x3
He was just there a second ago.
Where are you looking?
I don't want Chef Tam to see me.
Okay, okay.
Don't know what poultry that is, but it's nice.
Is that quail?
Or pheasant?
Could be pheasant.
Bone marrow, very unique texture.
Very.
I don't love that but if 
Chef Tam tells you to eat it,
- Yeah.
- One in a billion Chef.
- True.
- I kind of trust his opinion over my own.
You doubt your own taste buds.
I'm wrong.
Wow.
Wow.
This is more of a Chinese classic.
Wow, this is more familiar.
- I thought that was sauce.
- It's mantou.
- I thought that was actually sauce.
- You that was a pile of sauce.
You just picked it up.
It's mantou.
- Is it bread?
- This is very common in more northern China.
Sometimes you just dip it in condensed milk.
Beautiful.
Look at this.
Oh, that's different.
That's really different from 
from Beijing style duck.
- Smoky.
- Alright, let's do it.
It's smoky.
Really Smoky.
Little bit fatty for the flavour.
- It's not dry at all.
- Really lean.
Really juicy.
Bit of mantou.
Oh that takes me straight back.
Wow.
Growing up in China, I absolutely love this stuff.
Wow that's like eating a cloud.
But crispy, like crunch on the outside, right?
It's my favorite thing.
Super soft in the middle.
Easily my favourite thing.
The British guy.
The one beige item on the 
menu, his favourite thing.
So this restaurant is based around 24 Luna terms.
They have a seasonal menu 
which changes every 2 weeks.
That's intense.
That's like constantly new recipes, new dishes.
I mean, I don't change the things I cook at home.
You don't change your clothes every two weeks.
Sorry, sorry that's harsh.
Oh no, accurate.
I saw this.
We saw this on a restaurant menu outside.
- When we're walking last night.
- Walking around outside last night.
And I was like what is that I've 
never seen anything like that before.
I have no idea what the answer is is still.
This course is baked abalone and sea cucumber.
Okay, so, is is sea cucumber a fruit?
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's a living sea creature.
- That looks a bit like a...
- Like a...
I wasn't going to say that.
Didn't say that.
I feel like maybe,
he lured us into a false sense of security,
- with the last dish.
- Yes, definitely did.
Chef Tam, he's like these guys are too loud.
How can I shut them up.
Well it looks like an egg.
It's quite confusing
Gosh.
That's abalone.
Okay. It's kind of like a gelatinous flavour.
I don't love abalone.
Almost like liver.
Not helping.
I quite like that.
I am not a fan.
- No?
- No.
That was difficult to get down.
Oh wow this sea cucumber texture is very unique.
It's literally like jelly.
Mmh!
Oh.
That actually tastes really good.
Wow.
Texture.
Weird.
Super weird. But the taste...
I mean the texture, just tastes like,
it honestly just tastes like pork or beef fat.
When it's been properly cooked.
Super soft.
Super soft.
Not quite buttery.
Almost like jelly.
Okay, Luke, sea cucumber.
I think you need to try this.
The texture is going to freak you out.
It's good.
It's not even that fishy it's just...
The texture is like.
You don't like it?
The texture is...
- Challenging?
- ...not for me.
It feels like it's just moving 
around my mouth by itself.
It feels like it's got a mind of its own.
You're going to enjoy different main courses.
Oh, hello.
We've never ever had this.
Ever on the channel.
No one has like seen our responses to everything,
and been like we're going to give 
them two different main courses,
- That's amazing
- To suit their individual palates.
This rice is from Nepal.
On the tope is the tri-tip beef.
Ollie, these are your noodle.
We call it wonton skin noodles.
Wonton noodles, that's going to be good.
Let's go beef first.
Let's do it.
It's very conveniently two big chunks of beef.
Cheers mate.
Beef is marinated so it's super soft.
The rice though.
- The rice is unlike any rice I've ever had.
- That sauce.
We are getting so spoiled.
Wonton noodles just with so much crab meat,
That it looks like it's more crab 
meat with some wonton noodles.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
Oh that's incredible, the texture of the wonton.
Oh Chef Tam.
This is incredible.
You are one in a billion.
Amazing. Genuinely amazing.
This is the menu.
- This is the menu?
- Okay.
Is this what we tried?
What was the tiny bird?
What was the tiny bird?
- Partridge!
- Partridge!
It was a partridge.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for hosting us.
- This has been incredible.
- You're amazing.
Char siu.
Chef Tam prepared this for you.
Oh this is my favourite.
You find it all over Southern Chinese cuisine.
The bottom half of that tastes like sea cucumber.
It is a fatty texture.
That might be the best char siu I've ever had.
Luke, try that.
You had char siu for breakfast this morning.
That is going to put in to shame.
I could have that every 
morning, without a question.
My dad is going to watch this video,
and he's going to be livid.
Once again Daryl.
I'm so sorry, but it is an 
honor to be here in your place.
That's the best char siu you I've ever had.
It's a privilege to bring you here, son.
Okay.
I love a dessert.
I love a dessert.
Ooh!
Oh, no.
What do you mean, "Oh no"?
Is it bone marrow?
No, it's not bone marrow.
This one is snow pear.
On the top, it's the bird's nest.
And the other dish is crispy walnut custard.
Chef used the fresh walnut,
and then deep fried,
to make it crispy on the 
outside and soft on the inside.
What?
Walnut custard.
Oh my gosh.
- It's hot.
- Crispy outer layer, it's hot.
Oh, wow.
Oh, I dropped mine in.
No one saw, no one saw.
I'm going to save that for the last bite.
Oh my gosh, that's incredible.
Oh my gosh.
What the heck is Walnut custard?
That tastes amazing.
What the heck is superior bird's nest?
About to find out.
What the heck is regular bird's nest?
Wow.
What?
Tastes like hot pear flavoured jelly.
Michelin style pear Boba.
Right, it's kind of reminiscent, 
the combination of textures.
Wow. Oh Chef.
You're good with the menu today?
- Oh cheers to you.
- Amazing.
Cheers to Chef Tam.
This was incredible.
- The whole menu was really really amazing.
- You're a genius.
One in a billion.
One in a billion.
Absolutely incredible.
Thank you for your compliment.
Yes, actually we hope everyone 
who visits us in the restaurant,
they're going to have a good experience.
There were some dishes which were very new to us.
Like the sea cucumber very strange texture.
Yeah.
But even if it's new, I mean, it's 
still such an incredible experience.
I didn't like the bone marrow.
I'm sorry.
Do you like it?
Like Jell-o.
Yeah.
I'll look forward to serving you again.
- Oh, please.
- I would love to come back.
Next time, you know, for dimsum?
- Yes, please!
- Oh!
- I mean are we busy tomorrow?
- For lunch?
I'm a proper Tambourine.
Mate, just so happy to be here with you man.
Aww.
- Love you.
- You too man.
This is the best job in the world.
Thank you guys for watching.
See you JOLLY soon.
Cheers.
