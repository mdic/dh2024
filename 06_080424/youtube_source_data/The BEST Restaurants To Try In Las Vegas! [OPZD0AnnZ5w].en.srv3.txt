all right what's up dvw fam so we're
back in Las Vegas and then this video
I'm gonna take you guys all around the
city and show you guys some of my top
picks my favorite restaurants here some
of the best eats in Las Vegas and on our
first stop we got lotusion Thai
restaurant so let's go inside and uh get
some dinner let's go
[Music]
all right guys so our food just came
here Lotus of Scion this is one of my
favorite restaurants in Las Vegas tried
a little bit of everything on their menu
in a previous video with jaycation so
make sure you guys check that but we got
a little something something here and
appetizer soup salad and uh one of my
favorite things here is anything duck
and their Curry their cow soil is
awesome here too we had that in the last
video opens there duck Curry look at
this guys oh swimming in a Jacuzzi or
red curry what'd you get here it's
called the Ricky's Royal it had like
butterfly tea ginger ale and a couple
other things not it's good it's very
refreshing it's not an alcoholic by the
way
how they look
all right so this is a northern Tom car
right here let's try some soup it's cold
night right now
very light comforting
Herbie some chicken in here
very good soup it is spicy like Laya
said but never had tamka but it's really
spicy but it's it's really great flavor
so I'm actually really enjoying it
good amount of spicy tingles the tongue
this is the beef salad right here
actually rib eye salad so they say it's
one of their top items the ribeye should
be cooked to Perfection we got a medium
all right try out their Thai rib eye
salad right here
a nice big piece of ribeye
really soft juicy tender has a nice
sweet like balsamic sweet Thai glaze on
there
nice fresh greens but the highlight
it's definitely in that rib eye it is
cooked Perfection it is on point
love Thai beef salad guys
that river is nice and sweet extremely
juicy
all right so on to the star of the show
The Duck Curry
the duck this is the one of their main
entrees right here if you guys get one
thing here guys definitely get the duck
Curry let's try this out
that's seriously orgasmic
it's crazy that it's dunked in like kind
of like a creamy red a little bit spicy
curry but the crunchiness on the duck
keeps its Integrity with the crunchiness
of the crispy fatty skin on top then you
bite into the duck it's extremely juicy
you know Doug it's like a fatty poultry
oh I love duck love Northern Thai food
if you guys don't know the theme of
lotus Siam it is a northern Thai
establishment so yeah I actually been to
Chiang Mai I had the cow soy there a lot
of the northern Thai food there and the
food here is just on par as back over
there it is Bomb guys but can't Rave
enough about this duck Curry
fire
[Music]
okay Leia's gonna try the ribeye salad
right now
smells really good even without having
to drink
it's really good it tastes like um I
think what stands out is obviously
delivered by it's like marinated really
really deliciously I think I could eat
this every day that spice on that soup
creeps up on you my head is kind of like
tingling a little bit but it's it's
still good guys
it's like that good type of spice creeps
up in you for sure so non-spicy food
eaters beware so you know when you have
good curry you gotta get white rice
right here and put a nice warm blanket
of that red curry all over the rice
so the rice can soak up all the flavors
from the curry
oh so just take on all the flavors let's
take a piece
can be the combination of Korean rice oh
you got some ginger in there too from
the soft slices of the red bell pepper
so much herbs and spices
all right guys just left I'm stuffed
needless to say dvw score 10 out of 10.
this is one of my favorite spots to eat
in Vegas how about you honest opinions
honestly opinion best Thai food I've had
everything is delicious we only have
three dishes although I could tell that
this place is really good so yeah
some of the best duck I've had if not
the best duck all right y'all so we're
at the Planet Hollywood at our next
essential eats in Las Vegas tour right
outside Gordon Ramsay Burger one of my
favorite restaurants here so let's go
inside and get our grub on let's go
we're gonna Ramsey Burger
it's lit in here
so I actually been here before once I
actually really love most of the Gordon
Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas but this
is Leia's first time trying the burger
she actually really enjoyed Hell's
Kitchen when we went to so are you
excited yeah I like Hell's Kitchen and I
like the gore
house so yeah I'm excited we actually
have a negative story to tell about
Gordon Ramsay later on and uh it's
actually a funny story so we'll tell you
that while we're eating later so stay
tuned Leia said this looks like a Krabby
Patty because it's so perfect all right
y'all so our Burgers here their burgers
actually come separately so you gotta
order the fries separately but they're
big enough to share I would say it's
good enough for two people so it's the
Truffle fries right here I got some
truffle aioli sauce some cheddar Ranch
and Magnolia ketchup whatever that is so
I got the basically the Brady short rib
Burger it's called 24 Hour Burger it is
a Gordon Ramsay restaurant so it's very
um fancy Chef driven so all their salsa
are made in house the cheddar Ranch the
Truffle Magnolia ketchup so Leia just
asked for ketchup bottle right now they
don't have Heinz like they don't have
the regular ketchup so this is a 24-hour
Burgers spray short rib red eye barbecue
sauce white cheddar cheese brown sugar
bacon arugula cold brew vinaigrette
pickled shallots
but yeah and then Leia got the Backyard
Burger it's like their basic Burger
American cheese butter lettuce tomato
pickled red onion so it's like their
basic burger and uh layers that look
perfect like crappy Patty so oh I love
my fries pick at them all day see some
truffle on the top let's take one with
just a little bit of truffle
um
really thick fries really crispy
tastes a lot of like that parmesanian
flavor from the truffle
we look crunchy well let's try with the
Rancho cheddar
we're gonna say it's a really thick
Ranch oh lady's gonna take a bite of her
Backyard Burger
look at that that Krabby Patty right
there
Leia's a big burger kind of store she
loves Burgers she introduced me to Red
Robin actually
so yeah bottomless fries guys what do
you think about the burger
gourmet burger
can't beat the classics right just tried
that cheddar Ranch let's try the Truffle
aioli
[Music]
that wasn't good that tastes like really
creamy I got aioli sauce
let's see what this Magnolia ketchup is
about
[Applause]
looks like there might be some
horseradish in there like a cocktail
sauce and a ketchup in one I think my
favorite one might be the Truffle I
always
it's different I haven't had a sauce
like that
it's like a bite into this 24 Hour
Burger right here see why it's 24 hours
[Music]
nice soft bun soft all the way
throughout I could taste the barbecue
sauce right away a sweet barbecue sauce
but gotta take another bite
oh
that bag is nice and thick crunchy say
some of the Brady short River here
not too much of the short rib but it's
nice and tender oh I was wondering where
the sweetness from came from these fresh
ingredients the radish right here
this burger is overall on the sweet side
it's meaty and sweet but very soft and
tender patties cooked to Perfection it's
a nice medium
I always mistooking so most of the
braised short rib is actually in the
back it kind of tastes like Barbacoa it
kind of has like that
Chipotle spice like a like a Mexican
spice to it not like I thought it would
kind of be like an American shortbread
but kind of like a barbacoa
[Applause]
but guys the reason why I just won my
favorite Gordon Ramsay restaurant so
that you know when you have a burger
it's always burgers fries and shakes
their shakes are on point here they got
the sticky toffee pudding shake and they
got the sticky toffee pudding Cookie
Sandwich so he specialized in sticky
toffee pudding if you go to any of his
restaurants there's like sticky toffee
pudding alternative Hell's Kitchen they
actually have the sticky toffee pudding
like the regular one here the burger
restaurant they got the shakes the fish
and chips I think has shakes too and the
steakhouse has like some other sticky
toffee pudding stuff but yeah guys we
came here for a dessert so we're gonna
kill these fries and burgers and uh onto
the shakes all right guys y'all know why
I'm here this is a sticky toffee pudding
ice cream sandwich right here it looks
crazy
let's try it out y'all we're gonna get
the shake too afterwards so the burgers
were pretty good I'll give a dvw score
8.5 out of 10. kind of expensive but
it's what you expect on the Las Vegas
Strip but they're very quality delicious
burgers but this is what tops it off the
dessert so let's try it out let's try
this out guys look at this
wow
Just So Soft oh look at this
oh my God that cookie is so soft just
melts in your mouth like butter
and it's nice and warm
and then that cold eyes and just
neutralizes that heat
that's so good
oh and then you just kind of mix it with
that sticky toffee caramel oh
and this hits home with me because I
love my soft cookies I like the soft
Chips Ahoy One the red package not the
blue one
and this ticket I'll be putting I hear a
cookie you think it's a little crunchy
but this cookie is very soft kind of has
like a cinnamony flavor and the thing
about toffee is that it's sweet I mean
it's toffee but it's not too sweet it's
not like straight up chocolate or fudge
which I love in my desserts not having
it too sweet
that's an orgasm in your mouth I'll come
here just for dessert salute fire
Gordon Ramsay sticky toffee pudding
anything is the best dessert guys hands
down it's more of like a soft bread than
anything than like a cookie
[Music]
so good oh I know what that cinnamon
flavor is coming from but there's brown
butter ice cream in it that's what it is
all right guys so we can't get enough of
their dessert well I can't get enough of
it we got the English coffee shake I
mean we're already here so might as well
go all in
yeah
some thick whipped cream
boom some like coffee bits on the top
take a piece of this Biscoff cookie
love this golf
oh my gosh
such a thick Shake I love thick shakes
by the way going with him and sip it let
me use a spoon
oh my God
it's so thick it's almost like the ice
cream in that cookie we decided but just
like blend it up into a shake
thank you
nice and cold you had that nice caramel
drizzle and like little bits of toffee
in there
bar ground butter ice cream
so thick so good I love Gordon Ramsay's
sticky toffee anything I definitely
prefer the cookie though that one's
unique
sticky toffee pudding cake and that
cookie is my favorite so far but this
shake is still on point it's salute
overall experience at Gordon Ramsay
Burgers like 9 out of ten a little bit
pricey like I said but it's on this trip
great Vibe great experience the service
it's always great here our server is
very friendly and nice last time I went
here to the servers we're also very
friendly it's always busy but they'll
get you seated if you're down to wait
but we had no weight on this time but
it's very crowd in here so yeah guys on
to our next location let's go
foreign
[Applause]
to avocado it's gonna be our cream base
and then from watermelon to chili mango
it's gonna be our water base so honestly
my opinion are it's basically like
Chipotle you uh take samples then once
you pick your Panetta we'll take you
down for mine so chocolate uh toppings
awesome thank you foreign
[Music]
and it smells really good too
wow
um drizzling with milk chocolate wow
then smothered in the graham crackers
[Music]
oh my gosh
that's s'mores oh my gosh thank you
[Music]
[Music]
all right guys about to devour this
cooking cream marshmallow s'mores
paletta right here let's try it out
oh my God
what the hell
I know you guys saw that marshmallow
pool
it feels like I'm biting into a pillow
of cookies and cream and marshmallow
goodness
hmm
this is literally fire
Flames guys this is amazing I've
actually had paletta before but this
palette in general is just really thick
and chewy it's like look at it
and literally just bite into it and on
the outside there's that s'mores crust
with the graham cracker
and then you just get the Milky creamy
but thick goodness of the belletta guys
this is fire oh my gosh
I literally just finished this in one
bite I can't stop oh so good
I love cookies and cream too because
there's Taro there's like a bunch of
other flavors there's fruity flavors but
um whenever I see cookies and cream at
any ice cream shop I always go for
cookies and cream but the Taro sampler
we had was really good as well it's like
some of the thickest consistency of like
a palette that I've ever had so good
yeah I really love this location
Shanghai Plaza that's why every like the
very delicious things across the feet
here so BBQ chicken right there and then
85 degree thicker right here and then
sumizomi serenbean yeah many desserts
you have over here also they have many
sushi place here so everything is
mostly Asian food right yeah that's why
Chinatown we are yeah so they
recommended me to get this one it's the
sunset drink right here let's try it out
wow
this is amazing I think it's um August
Frescas but it is a basically watermelon
with orange oh kind of tastes like a mai
tai but with watermelon I love
watermelon juice so refreshing
palette cleanse for the next location
let's go let's go
all right so for the third spot on this
tour we actually flew to Hawaii no I'm
just kidding but this spot is close
enough we're in downtown right now at
the California Hotel and Casino it's
kind of funny because this hotel is
called the California but it is a Aloha
and Hawaiian theme as you guys can see
they speak Aloha here so let's go inside
and check out some of their food all
right y'all so we're at our third Place
Aloha Specialties in the California this
is one of my favorite spots to get
Hawaiian and local type food this spot
has been voted best Hawaiian food in
2021 by the best of Las Vegas Journal so
yeah and I've been here a couple times
it's pretty good I got the Simon here
last time another couple of dishes but
today we just got the uh Aloha Bento
special right here so it comes with a
little bit of everything Teriyaki steak
uh teriyaki chicken a Redondo hot dog
sausage and someahi Mahi so try it out
also I would include this in kind of
like the Cheap Eats category because
I just came back from Hawaii guys this
looks like the real deal because they
really feed you out there this is like
15 something and it's a pretty hefty
plate with a lot of protein and rice and
when I was in Hawaii it was the same way
like they really fill up your plate so
throughout this Teriyaki or steak right
here oh it's like a whole state so we
gotta cut it off let's try out this
Teriyaki steak right here
a nice thin piece of grilled steak but
the key to this is the glaze it's a nice
thick Teriyaki glaze a little kick to it
sweet a little bit salty it's a good
glaze I'm gonna wash it down with this
white rice love eating rice with onion
proteins they also have mac salad too
here as a side one of my favorite sides
ever Hawaiian mac salad but this
particular plate doesn't come with it
but if you guys get some other ones they
might have that for you let's try this
uh teriyaki chicken right here
crispy crust on the top the sauce is
nice and caramelized on the chicken oh
it's really crunchy
oh I know why it's so crispy this is
actually Korean crispy chicken that's
why um the outer shells very crispy it's
not just regular teriyaki chicken it's
really good chicken thigh really juicy
on the inside has a nice glaze similar
to the steak teriyaki really like that
glaze really thick but uh just really
really crispy fire
I just take the skin
by itself is so crispy
really crispy and the soft teriyaki
sauce nice and caramelized on top of the
skin fire oh let's try this Redondo
sausage right here we got a little
wiener
a little bit sweet
Char on the outside it's kind of like
eating a hot dog without the bun but
with rice which is how I prefer to eat a
hot dog I actually don't like hot dog
buns
I'm weird like that all right let's try
this Mahi they already have some tartar
sauce lathered on top for us let's try
this out foreign
definitely need tartar sauce though
because it's not a lot of flavor on
there I mean that's why they gave it to
us but I like Mahi because it's not like
a flaky fish there's a lot of protein to
the fish so it almost has like a
consistency of like chicken or like
another type of meat because yeah like I
said it'll fill you up you'll get your
protein with the fish and all these
other meat items the main selling point
of Aloha special because it's just the
Cheap Eats like they have a little bit
of everything on the menu Simon local
plate lunches just a little taste of
Hawaii a little taste of Aloha pork very
inexpensive prices very casual eats and
um okay quick bowl and you're on your
way to fill you up all right dvw score
for Aloha Specialties nine out of ten
certified hello DBW fans and hello to my
family in Northern California San
Francisco Bay Area all right to
everybody in the Philippines all right
story time me and Larry are going to
tell you guys the story that we had with
Gordon Ramsay so basically Leia signed
us up for a Hell's Kitchen tasting in La
we got there we're really hungry we
didn't eat beforehand because we wanted
to try their food so basically like you
sign up you're kind of like an extra on
their Hell's Kitchen show so they feed
you for free basically yeah we drove
there and we had to wait in like this
waiting room with a bunch of other
contestants or not contestants just like
extras we went for like over two hours
we're really hungry they're calling in
groups we saw a group go in after group
they're calling Group after group and we
were getting kind of nervous we're like
oh they're gonna get us I mean we drove
all this way takes like an hour and a
half to get there basically during prime
time traffic
and then
there was like maybe seven people left
oh it's too traumatizing I can't talk
about it
the worst part is that we were hungry
hungry like we came hungry wanting to go
foreign
so then when they came out they were
like and there was a few of us like us
and a few other couples and they're like
unfortunately we're already fully booked
so they overbooked people knowing that
like not everybody would be seated which
we didn't really know that so then we
were actually unfortunately told to
leave like there's nothing they can do
they can't see this they were trying to
reschedule us to come back another time
for another team I wasn't going to drive
an hour and a half to come back after
that experience because it was far away
it was like somewhere in L.A somewhere
the whole location was just like it just
took a while we had to get covet tested
like it was a whole thing so we were
really disappointed it was just uh then
we went to Global Paradise after so yeah
we went to eat somewhere after that was
good well we were starving and then we
were disappointed we kind of went our
time and mostly because we really wanted
to be on the on the Hell's Kitchen like
we thought it would be a really fun
experience yeah but I actually can't
really get mad it was free yeah we found
a good restaurant after so it's all good
but yes
I mean going around to these restaurants
are good I mean it's obviously not his
fault it was like kind of like their
Staffing or whatever but anyways that is
our Gordon Ramsay fail story all right
so we're ending our video here in Hawaii
no I'm just kidding this is just a
painting guys some people call Las Vegas
and Ninth Island and California hotel is
one of the hot spots here in Vegas for
Hawaiians alright guys so if you guys
