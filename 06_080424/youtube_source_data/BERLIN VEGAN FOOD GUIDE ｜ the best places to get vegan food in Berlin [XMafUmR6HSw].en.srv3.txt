you're gonna tell me

[Music]
i can't see your face

hello everyone and welcome back
after our seven hour train rides we have
finally arrived in vegan food heaven
berlin
[Music]
let's just start the video with my
absolute favorite restaurant in berlin
which is 1990 vegan living
i have been to this restaurant at least
50 times if not more they serve amazing
vietnamese food and they have bigger
bowls and small bowls and mostly when we
are there we just order lots of small
bowls and then share everything
next up is la stella nera it's an
awesome pizza place in noi collin
and they make their own vegan cheese and
if you are there in summer definitely
take the pizza to go and eat it on
temple fa field
plus 84 is also one of my favorite
vietnamese restaurants in berlin
it is located in mita
it has great drinks great starters
and mostly i get the far which is one of
the best soups i've ever had
and the whole restaurant is completely
vegan good morning vietnam is another
completely vegan restaurant they serve
amazing far and they also have a dish
with vegan duck
and you definitely have to try this
drink taipis motto
kind of like a lemonade but with soy
milk and it's super tasty
mom's creation is surprise another
completely vegan vietnamese restaurant
but i love berlin for that and it
doesn't get boring
every restaurant is definitely totally
different than the other
to get to our next place to eat we
rented one of those red scooters the
ride was pretty freezing because it was
the end of november but eventually we
arrived at mana
if you want to eat something healthy
this is definitely the right place for
you
green gourd is a bistro slash takeaway
place i would say
and i was so surprised they offer so
many delicious sandwiches bagels and
wraps
we tried two of them and they were
absolutely amazing
if this wasn't our last day we would
have definitely gone there again
marafina is my favorite place to get
falafels this place isn't all vegan
though and also with the falafel you
have to say that you want it vegan back
when i was living in berlin i went there
at least once a week even though it was
like 45 minutes away from my home
definitely check out this place they
offer nepalese and indian cuisine they
have a great variety for vegans
and the waiter there was so nice
the zen house is a big restaurant it was
decorated very nicely
they don't have as many vegan options
they have only this one here
i think this place is great if you go
there with like or colleagues or friends
that aren't vegan because everyone can
find something and i think this vegan
sushi platter is really really delicious
it is definitely my favorite place to
eat sushi in berlin
our next food place was only 30 minutes
away from where we were staying
so we went through this nice park
glitched by egg park
and we went to our all-time favorite
donut shop which is pranipals donuts
probably you've heard of it i think
everyone did
this place sells the most delicious
donuts in town
or on the planet i don't know
and they have awesome coffee
it's a nice place to watch people
because they have those big windows they
have great music too
and the great thing is that they have
like five or six different stores in
berlin
so
doesn't matter where we are there is
going to be brownie balls donuts each
month they have new flavors and they're
always super creative with new flavor
ideas
i think nomad today is one of the cutest
cafes in town and they have delicious
things like this carrot cake here
goodies another one of my favorites
but sadly not completely vegan but still
they have amazing options
this bakery full contact by half fish
is so amazing it is such a cute little
bakery they sell so many delicious
things like from crew sauce to
cinnamon rolls through those amazing nut
corners i don't know how to say that in
english they also sell sandwiches and
bagels and their bread is so amazing
it is not completely vegan but you will
definitely find a lot of vegan goodies
there
definitely worth a visit is cafe cansla
it is located in the middle of kudan
which is like a very busy area a lot of
people are there a lot of cars there's
just a lot going on and it is perfect to
watch the city
at their beautiful terrace
and they sell amazing coffee
i definitely wanted to include like and
yo-yo's food world in this video as well
but sadly this time we didn't have
enough time to go there but i used to be
there all the time back when i was
living in berlin our time in berlin has
come to an end and i thought i would
also share all the snacks that we took
with us for the train ride we found
those awesome sandwiches at the train
station from
pratt
then i got some vegan croissants and
transportion from beeo company
and this amazing avocado dried tomato
sandwich from
back there
[Music]
we also ate some bulgogi salad
and then a friend of mine made us this
amazing cake
snack wise we ate some things from
vegans the vegan supermarket in berlin
and we had their seaweed straps
vegan speculations and this chocolate
thing
i hope this video was helpful for you
bye bye
