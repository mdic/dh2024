hi guys and welcome back to another
video today we will be taking on a
challenge we will be visiting the worst
rated restaurants in London I have
decided to pick up three restaurants and
I'm going to visit all three of those
today I hope my stomach can handle it I
really hope that the reviews are not as
bad as the food waiting for Amal because
she said she's gonna come with me but
she's refused to eat the first
restaurant will be going to is Palace
restaurant rated the worst restaurant in
London One reviewer said prison food
please don't go here avoid avoid avoid
another said we were eating outside and
they kicked us out without a reason
discussing from the outside it looks as
if it hasn't been decorated since the
90s now we look at the five star reviews
lovely place the lady at the counter ate
my pencil case and threw a block of
cheese at me the rest was so kind and
kept me company while I went into
cardiac arrest from the food very good
place if you do not wish to keep your
pencil case stop it get some help my
wife had only three years to live but
when I took her yesterday to this
restaurant her lifespan went from three
years to dead within seconds
delicious food deserves a Michelin star
10 out of 10. would recommend to those
feeling suicidal
amazing I am paraplegic in a wheelchair
and I could honestly say the smell from
the horrible rancid food that they were
cooking here had the power to heal my
disability as I'm compelled to get up
and walk out the restaurant
why are you running
why are you running this place serves
great salmonella viruses and diseases if
you like rats this is the place to come
so guys this is the restaurant as you
guys can see the p and the A and the L
is missing it's supposed to be Palace
Cafe restaurant that lady that's smoking
at the front is the owner
and
yeah
[Music]
okay
the guy she points me at the menu and
then she just walks off like I never
asked for a table of two
why is this boarded up no the fish and
chips is down there in the cafe there's
so many different types of things that
don't have covers as you guys can see
there's these like baklavas and then on
this side there's just random snacks
that just lay about yeah
the owner walked in and she gave me the
menu and I ordered myself a Coke and
melted an actual order a drink and she
wasn't forced to order a drink whereas
the other waitress was too busy doing
her makeup maybe she needs to get ready
to push her chest horse we just ordered
ourselves fish and chips and chocolate
potato I'm not gonna lie to you my God's
making it behind me
if you guys can see that is the fight
they use that tiny little fryer where
she fries the fish and the chips and to
make things worse she put my jacket
potato on a grill so cut in half and put
on the grill
and this one's not doing her hair
fish
chips and some tartar sauce
this is the jacket potato with some
cheese and some salad
as soon as I walked in the lady was
watching me but it got even worse when I
started eating like she sat right next
to me guys imagine she sat on my left
hand side just staring me down and this
is the fish it's not that bad it's just
very very oily
the fries are very very dry and hot
she keeps getting up looking at me
walking sitting back down and then I
should just starts talking to me about
my videos
recorded
everything needs to be recorded whatever
you do
wow
I just wanted to keep it short and
simple and just try and eat the cheese
and the beans because that jacket potato
was harder than my forehead
so the woman's left now she was outside
smoking a cigarette
down there
when we were eating and whatnot this
tastes absolutely vile I'm not gonna lie
to you the chips looked like they came
last week but the fish wasn't too bad it
was just very oily
um this was on a grill she just added
two tablespoons of big big beans and the
cheese the potato itself is super hot
it is hot enough she's smoking right
there it's coming into it you could
smell the cigarette smoke there was
another lady I don't know where she went
then
where's the light
oh this there was a light this is the
toilet
it's not bad
foreign
but it's not that bad so the price came
up to
38 pounds
what did you think about the food amount
scary concerning so you don't like the
fish
the fish was
land to the officials blunt the chips
were made days ago yeah they cooked and
we cooked and we cooked the jacket
potato
no but the salt was on the table what
about the jacket potato
a jacket potato I've never had Jack
potato like that
that was one potato cut in half yeah
like
that and there was a little bit of
cheese in it like a little bit of cheese
a little bit of beans that little dead
salad on the side which was brownish
there was hair on the table the chairs
were scary and old old today they were
okay and then and then the fact that she
went up for a bag and she'll come back
in no she went out for a but the
fact smell is just coming into the
restaurant
but I never once saw her wearing glove
Chris just to scattered around then they
had all of these dry cakes and stuff
cookies cookies that are exposed they're
open they're not packing like it's just
it was such a random it was like a
corner shop as well yeah it is we were
the only customers yeah everyone else
that came inside and just brought like
drinks water and orange juice for seven
pounds 15. that was really expensive you
know my drink was three pound fifty okay
yeah she did though this was realistic
I'm not even who even pays 15 pounds on
paper fish and chips
oh my God no service charges 3.50 what
service yeah it was a service charge you
just sat there with a she was
staring at us the whole time yeah oh my
good guys yeah so like obviously a slime
recording and she literally sat like
opposite me so that's why I kept saying
like all the food's amazing and I kind
of like I just I don't know what else
decisions staring at me as soon as you
sat on the opposite I couldn't record
her and then she was like oh do you have
to be recording like all the food I
think she knows that people only come to
her because they know it's the worst
rated restaurant
um she did it she didn't know but she
was nice though she wasn't rude at any
point
because we have to now catch a bus to
the next location
[Music]
as we are in Piccadilly Circus
as you guys can see there is a protest
[Music]
the next restaurant we went to is
restaurant Aroma it's in Leicester
Square and it has a rating of 1.5 it's
an embarrassment to Italian cuisine
don't go run away immediate illness
terrible service awful fruit tasteless
terrible experience shocking food not a
place for pizza lovers the worst Italian
pizza I've ever had this is the menu
[Music]
I don't know what you guys can see but
look how old it is marks
[Music]
look at that bro
that's a lipstick thing
tastes good though
yeah so this is the pizza this is
fries
this is cut like hello wonky but like it
doesn't look that bad
let's go
okay
it has absolutely no taste
I've never seen such translucent ketchup
always good to start the faster I
probably feel the biggest
[Music]
there's so much these are the chips guys
they look like they've been defrosted
I'm not fried
taste
oh
that fish that we had was olive oil
this sounds like it tastes meaty pasta
it's good though
there's that tomato
peppers are cooked
and then there's like coriander on top
Korean on top it looks really nice
though like look it looks nice yeah it
looks really pretty like nice and
whatnot
flavor
[Music]
service charges bought pound 99
thank you
guys
so let's just shout and fly inside the
place to shout out one another
I'm sorry there's someone just behind
the door but there's a massive two for
the toilet there's like five people
the food was absolutely shocking
um the pizza I think like they probably
have a regular surprise frozen frozen
pizzas and they just stick it into the
oven
um the pasta I the pasta was like half
cooked and then they just added like a
teaspoon of like yeah tomato puree they
cut up like bell peppers to hide like to
give it flavor it did absolutely nothing
um the chips
the chips I don't know whether they were
chips
I don't know whether they were chips or
whether they were like
like animal-made fries or something they
had a strong barbecue beefy taste I
don't know where that came from it's the
last spot yeah we're gonna go to is a um
it's an Indian restaurant it is supposed
to be the worst Indian restaurant in
London so I can't wait to go there I
don't think it's getting worse
foreign
thing that you will see in London is
entertainment and there's entertainment
everywhere literally
[Music]
I've lost stop Taj Mahal one person said
that he's a scam and adds more to the
price another got charged 44 pounds for
two people a bad service and he tries to
attract to his flattery he was horrible
talking too much and he added 30 pounds
on their bill these two also had bad
experiences High charges low portions
Taj Mahal
would you like some beans oh yes
um you like mango or fruit

good first come on good for Billy no I
think let's stick to water please okay
thank you yeah I'm ready yeah pay me

temperatures oh can I get cold please
foreign
two different one
okay
have you got papadums
[Music]
the guy's a sweet talker he likes to you
know compliment you but he just doesn't
stop talking guys
distance
that doesn't tastes so good
only good not fantastic oh it's amazing
young lady I'm fantastic boy where are
you from I'm from
I'm from the sky
Bangladesh I knew it
is 21 years old
John laughing please you look you look
no older than 21. yeah thank you very
much you are my daughter don't worry
I've never seen a glass of Ross
some onions some chili sauce garlic Mayo
and some what is it is
popcorn
this is spicy
it tastes like spicy pan
the spicy though oh that's really spicy
this is
no that's not
foreign
smells absolutely Sensational why are
the onions so big though
onions
egg fried rice
it was an absolutely tasteless and dry
yeah
is like three weeks left over
here
and hard
try some Dawn
we love some melon bread this is some
different type of lawn right there
in it yeah
the curry was very spicy but not really
flavorful
chicken is very sweet biryani
I can't wait to try everything
everything
foreign
[Music]
you know you've got something in the
microwave is it me or does that like um
this looks microwavable microwavable
they're not I'm not too sure of the rice
you don't know the whole day today
[Music]
Palace
the Italian
they're all really scary but I think for
me personally maybe this Curry was the
scariest it's very sweet though yeah but
I mean it's better than
efficient in that place it's better than
the pizza in the pasta the pizza yeah
the piece was horrible
every customer that walks in he sees the
same things to the mango Lassie rice
like I Am the Doctor of cooking like
um
as soon as I told him about the NHS
discount his whole face changed and he
gave me like a really weird grin
thank you
don't tell anybody
oh don't tell people
this is done
58 55 then the discount
and then what's this then this is
biryani
this is
if we look at the menu it does say that
papadums are zero point something
whereas he charged us six pounds 90 for
Pompa domes so the chicken tikka yes he
did charge us correctly he then charged
me 11 pounds 95 for the shatori chicken
which is eight pounds 95. for the butter
chicken it is 8.95 so that he did charge
that correctly for the special fried
rice which was egg fried rice it was
three pounds something which is correct
however for the naan he charged us 11
pounds 55 for three when one is about
two pounds something I can't really see
because of the menu not only were the
price is incorrect but the calculation
was
six pounds ninety plus 11 pounds 95 plus
11 pounds 95 again plus eight pounds 95
plus three pounds 95 plus 11 pounds 85.
comes up to 55.55
let's work out the percentage of 15
which is 0.5 as 1 times 15 is 8.33
if we minus this from 55.55 it leaves us
with 47 pounds 21p
now we will minus this from the 14.85
drink and that comes to 62 pounds and
six pence he charged me 64 pounds and 85
Pence
why was the drinks not in the 15 percent
and why was the calculations incorrect
if you look closely at the receipt you
can see he put
96.40 as the total but scribbled it out
because I think you realize the
stupidity it doesn't say goodbye
and he was like oh don't tell anybody
that you guys want the 15 discount
um the food there like the guy is so
nicely at the beginning like he was so
welcome he gives you offered what not
here would do telling you to get
everything under the sun and as soon as
the bill comes my guy had an attitude
the worst attitude ever I just want to
review what was your review
what did your review say
oh
can I see this I want to read your
review
one star because I have no choice
suddenly spent 60 to 70 pounds it's so
bad he's a scam he adds more to the
price and brings you food on the house
but charges you for it do not go here
also the food is microwaved and then
it's so rude and invested towards the
Annie bro
um I would never recommend this place
this is probably the worst place I've
ever been to out of all the places I've
been to today was an interesting day I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
