cookies and a wide ranging menu with
burgers and salads and stuff like that

macaron
and a sandwich to share
so this has corn tomato cucumber
and some sort of vegan mayo yeah

like a focaccia i think
yeah
it's good
[Music]
oh how did you cut this i have a bit
more than that
oh you're making a mess
i know
it's immediate no eggs the freshness
it tastes like custard
yes it's crazy
but it's vegan
well that's crazy
that's impressive
i wonder what they use
do your best it's dropping yeah be
careful all right
i barely got anything oh okay it's
really good it's fine it's super sweet
it's my caramel babe it's normal god
it's like candy
when was the last time you headed my
camera
oh no
it's very elegant
i've destroyed it oh my gosh
i think i haven't had a macaroni in like
seven years
how is it though it's not my favorite
the custard is too sweet for you
yeah it's too sweet but the custard is
good on the inside
yeah i don't think i like macaroni
can you think it's too sweet
yeah you don't think so but don't try
larger as my car
they are even further i like that you
say lingerie with an american accent
it's for listeners so if you don't they
understand
say it with a french accent
my hot ride
